Introduction
Welcome to the 2025 edition of the (roughly) biennial Information Risk Insights Study (IRIS). The last one was in 2022, so it’s about time we got this to you. Thanks for your patience.

Fittingly, time is of the essence in this IRIS. Not just because it’s a tad overdue, but because it’s literally about time—cyber risk trends over time, to be specific.

Cybersecurity is ever-changing, and there’s an implicit assumption that risk is always increasing. But is it?

Are cyber events occurring at greater frequency? Is an organization more likely to have a breach now than 15 years ago? Which types of incidents have become more common over time? Have the financial impacts of cyber events increased or decreased? Are risk factors trending the same way for all sectors and sizes of organizations?

We explore these questions and more by analyzing a huge historical dataset of cyber events and losses from 2008 through 2024. As always, our goal is to dispel the fog of FUD surrounding cyber risk so you can see it more clearly and manage it more effectively. Thanks for reading!
