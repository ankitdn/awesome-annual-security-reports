## Executive summary

Cyber threats are evolving faster
than enterprise defenses can
adapt—and generative AI is
widening the gap.

This is not merely a technical issue; it is a
strategic risk. The cyber threat landscape is
being reshaped not only by technology, but by
geopolitics. Heightened global tensions, changing
trade dynamics and shifting regulations are
compounding cyber exposure. As companies
respond by adjusting supply chains and data
strategies, many are unknowingly introducing new
cyber risks—especially when security assessment,
compliance and risk protocols fail to keep pace.

With unprecedented speed and scale, AI is
enabling attackers to bypass legacy systems and
overwhelm security teams. Traditional defenses
are no longer sufficient. Our State of Cybersecurity
2025 research shows just 36% of technology
leaders acknowledge that AI is outpacing their
security capabilities—yet a staggering 90% of
companies lack the maturity to counter today’s
AI-enabled threats.

Our research reveals that 77% of organizations lack
the foundational data and AI security practices
needed to safeguard critical models, data pipelines
and cloud infrastructure[^1]. These are not just
vulnerabilities—they are systemic blind spots that
leave enterprises fundamentally unprepared to
defend against modern, AI-driven threats.

While AI adoption races ahead, security is playing
catch-up. Speed and innovation continue to eclipse
safety, with less than half (42%) of organizations
striking a balance between AI development and
security investment[^2]. Just 28% of organizations
embed security into transformation initiatives from
the outset—forcing many to scramble to retrofit
defenses later, often under duress[^3]. This reactive
approach places growing pressure on already
stretched security teams.

Only **34%**
of organizations have a mature
cyber strategy. Fewer still—just
**13%**—possess the advanced cyber
capabilities needed to defend
against modern, AI-driven threats.

The challenge is compounded by a persistent talent
shortage: 83% of executives cite workforce limitations
as a major barrier to sustaining a secure posture[^4].

Drawing on rigorous research, our work with
leading organizations and in-depth interviews with
security executives worldwide, we assess the scope
of organizations’ rapidly evolving cybersecurity
challenges in this report. Our analysis identifies
three security maturity zones that most companies
need to address across two dimensions: cyber
strategy maturity—how effectively organizations
design and implement cyber risk strategies—and
cyber capability—the technical depth required
to build cyber resilience and secure increasingly
complex, cyber-physical systems.

The findings are sobering. Only 34% of organizations
have a mature cyber strategy. Fewer still—just 13%—
possess the advanced cyber capabilities needed to
defend against modern, AI-driven threats[^5]. The vast
majority remain exposed, underprepared and at risk
of falling behind as AI-powered threats accelerate.

But there's a path to safety, a high ground we call
the Reinvention-Ready Zone. Only 10% of companies
have reached this level[^6]. These companies
demonstrate maturity in both strategy and capability
with a proactive, adaptive and resilient security
posture that continuously evolves to counter
emerging threats. The payoff? Compared to those
in the most vulnerable zone, which we refer to as
the Exposed Zone, this group of companies are 69%
less likely to be hit by an advanced attack such as
AI-powered cyberattack[^7]. They also see 1.6 times
higher returns on their AI investments and reduce
technical debt by 1.7 times—fueling faster, more
secure innovation[^8]. These companies report building
stronger customer trust, 1.6 times more than those in
the Exposed zone, a critical factor in sustaining long-
term business success[^9].

Our economic modeling of security outcomes
reveals that a 10% increase in security investment,
strategically directed toward Reinvention-Ready
Zone practices, can enable organizations to detect,
contain and remediate cyber threats 14% faster[^10].

We recommend four decisive actions for companies to
achieve Reinvention-Ready Zone status. These actions
not only protect AI investments but also leverage AI to
enhance cybersecurity defenses and resilience.

01 Develop and deploy a fit-for-purpose security
governance framework and operating model
accounting for the realities of an AI-disrupted world.
Establish clear accountability and align AI security
with regulatory and business objectives. With 72% of
organizations reporting increased cyber threats and
63% citing an evolving threat landscape as their biggest
challenge[^11], AI security cannot remain fragmented or
siloed—it must be embedded into governance structures
and elevated to a board-level priority to ensure sustained
investment and leadership buy-in.

02 Design the digital core to be generative
AI-secure from the outset.
AI must be developed, deployed and operated with
security integrated at every stage, yet only 37% of
organizations assess AI security before deployment,
despite 66% recognizing AI’s transformative impact
on cybersecurity in the coming year[^12].

03 Maintain resilient AI systems with secure
foundations and proactive threat management.
Emerging AI-based cyberattacks—including AI worms
like Morris II—can embed malicious prompts into
AI models, allowing attackers to hijack AI systems
and compromise sensitive data. Without continuous
monitoring, independent third-party testing of
AI models and solutions, robust third-party risk
management and AI-specific threat intelligence,
organizations will remain vulnerable to data poisoning,
model manipulation and adversarial AI attacks.

04 Reinvent cybersecurity with generative
AI to scale security capabilities, strengthen
cyber defenses and detect threats earlier.
With an estimated 4.8 million cybersecurity positions
unfilled worldwide[^13], AI presents an opportunity to
bridge the cybersecurity talent gap by amplifying
security professionals. AI-powered security solutions
analyze massive datasets, detect anomalies and help
predict attacks earlier than traditional methods. Our
research shows that 71% of security analyst tasks
can be amplified using generative AI, significantly
improving efficiency, reducing detection time and
enabling faster remediation of cyber threats[^14].

The message is clear:
act now.

Organizations that bake security into
their AI-powered transformations will not
only survive but thrive, gaining a crucial
competitive edge, cementing customer
loyalty and building unshakable resilience.

Ascending to the Reinvention-Ready Zone—
where robust security is deeply embedded
in both strategy and capability—requires
focused effort, strategic investment
and leadership from the top down. This
report provides the essential roadmap,
empowering organizations to close the
cybersecurity maturity gap and confidently
navigate the future of AI-driven innovation.

## Cyber threats are escalating

Cyber threats that have dominated
the landscape over the last few
years have not only persisted but
have intensified, becoming more
sophisticated, relentless and rapid.

Executives recognize this escalating risk; 72% report
a rise in cyber threats. The top 5 risks they rank as
most concerning are ransomware, cyber-enabled
fraud, supply chain attacks, malicious insiders
and disinformation[^15]. These threats are growing in
complexity, exploiting security gaps and placing
immense pressure on organizations to strengthen
their defenses before they become victim to attacks.
In the third quarter of 2024 alone, organizations faced
an average of 1,876 cyberattacks, reflecting a 75%
year-over-year increase[^16]. This increase is more than
a trend. It shows that attackers are using advanced
technologies to target weaknesses faster than
organizations can protect them.

Current geopolitical tensions are accelerating this
risk further. Tariffs, trade restrictions and international
instability are forcing organizations to reconfigure
global supply chains—changes that often happen
without fully accounting for cybersecurity impacts.
Each adjustment introduces new third-party vendors,
alters data access practices and potentially shifts
regulatory obligations, increasing exposure to both
known and emerging threats. Cybercriminals exploit
these moments of operational change, using them as
cover to target weak links, especially where security
posture assessments and threat intelligence have not
kept pace.

The AI revolution is escalating this challenge. The rise
of generative AI is reshaping industries, unlocking
unprecedented efficiency and innovation. However,
it is also amplifying cyber risks in ways that many
organizations are unprepared for.

![Figure 1: Estimated AI adoption. Our economic analysis projects 80% industry-wide growth in AI adoption over the next decade. The chart shows projected AI adoption percentage over time for various industries (Education, Professional Services, Information, Financial Services, Wholesale Trade, Health, Total Construction, Retail, Manufacturing, Accommodation, Transportation). It highlights that in 5 years, AI adoption will reach 64.3% in Education, 54.6% in Professional Services, 48.6% in Information, 47.1% in Financial Services, 33.6% in Wholesale Trade, 40.1% in Health, 30% in Total Construction, 16.9% in Retail, 15.3% in Manufacturing, 14.2% in Accommodation, and 8.3% in Transportation. It also notes AI adoption will reach 50% by 2029Q2.]

Accenture’s Pulse of Change Index—based
on key business indicators—measures
change across six areas: Technology,
Talent, Economic, Geopolitical, Climate
and Consumer & Social. It shows that
technology change rose by 37% in 2024
compared to 2023. This is mostly because
of the fast growth of generative AI
applications. Executives are recognizing
its value; 83% acknowledge greater
business potential for generative AI based
on their past years’ experience, and 86%
plan to increase AI investments in 2025[^17].
This momentum signals an accelerating
shift—AI adoption is not just expanding
but becoming a cornerstone of business
strategy. Our economic analysis projects
even stronger industry-wide growth over
the next decade (Figure 1).

Only **20%**
of organizations express
confidence in their ability
to secure their generative
AI models against cyber risks.

Despite its promise, security risks tied to AI adoption
are becoming more evident. Over half of technology
leaders express concern over the rise in cyber
threats due to widespread AI accessibility. One in
three executives report AI is amplifying existing
attack vectors, making detection significantly more
challenging while also being directly leveraged in
cyberattacks[^18]. One such example is Morris II, an AI
worm developed by researchers from Cornell Tech,
the Israel Institute of Technology and Intuit. The
worm tricks models like ChatGPT and Gemini into
generating malicious prompts, which can then be
used to extract sensitive data from emails and even
send spam through compromised AI assistants.

Morris II is particularly concerning because it
demonstrates how adversarial self-replicating
prompts can embed themselves into text and
image files, manipulating AI systems without human
intervention[^19]. This raises alarm over the ability
of attackers to hijack AI models and use them for
persistent cyber threats.

Deepfake technology in particular presents an acute
and growing challenge. AI-generated forgeries can
convincingly mimic voices, videos and text, making it
nearly impossible to distinguish real from fake. These
threats extend beyond cybersecurity, jeopardizing
operational integrity and amplifying risk across the
entire institution. A sophisticated scam using AI-
generated voice technology impersonated Italy’s
Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to defraud high-
profile business figures, including Giorgio Armani
and members of the Beretta and Menarini families.
Scammers, posing as Crosetto and his staff, made
phone calls requesting around €1 million to be wired
to a Hong Kong bank account, claiming the funds
were needed to rescue kidnapped Italian journalists.

One entrepreneur transferred a large sum after
speaking with a fake "General Giovanni Montalbano,"
believing he was assisting a government operation.
The fraud was uncovered when a businessman
contacted Crosetto to verify the request, prompting
the minister to alert authorities and publicly warn
others[^20]. This attack highlights how AI-generated
deepfakes are becoming an increasingly effective
tool for cyber-enabled fraud, enabling large-scale
financial deception that bypasses traditional
security measures.

Concerns over AI-driven vulnerabilities extend even
further—50% of executives worry that large language
models (LLMs) expose sensitive data, and 57% fear
that threat actors could manipulate training data
to compromise AI model integrity. Despite these
growing threats, only 20% of organizations express
confidence in their ability to secure their generative
AI models against cyber risks, underscoring the
urgent need for stronger AI security measures[^21].

## The Security Maturity Gap: Most organizations lack the strategy and capabilities to withstand modern threats

Our research reveals a sobering
truth: a minority (36%) of tech
leaders admit generative AI’s
rapid rollout is outpacing their
ability to integrate security
measures[^22]; yet 90% lack the
security maturity needed to
combat modern threats[^23].

Additionally many organizations lack the foundational
elements necessary to improve their security
posture. For instance, 84% struggle to develop and
operationalize cyber risk strategies that align with
their transformation goals[^24].

Furthermore, 92% of organizations struggle with
essential resilience-building efforts, such as
pressure-testing defenses, understanding emerging
threats and establishing rapid response mechanisms.
Even implementing Zero Trust, a fundamental
security framework, poses a significant challenge
for 88% of organizations. This vulnerability extends
to the physical world, with 80% unable to effectively
protect their cyber-physical systems[^25].

A concerning 77% of organizations lag in adopting
essential Data & AI security practices[^26]. Only 22%
have implemented clear policies and training
for generative AI use, and a handful maintain a
comprehensive inventory of AI systems, crucial
for managing supply chain risks. Additionally,
data protection remains inadequate—only 25% of
organizations fully leverage encryption methods and
access controls to safeguard sensitive information in
transit, at rest and during processing[^27].

Security gaps extend into cloud infrastructure as well.
Despite AI's reliance on cloud-based processing, 83%
of organizations have not established a secure cloud
foundation with integrated monitoring, detection and
response capabilities[^28].

Only **10%**
of organizations occupy the coveted
Reinvention-Ready Zone, demonstrating
both robust security capabilities and
integrated cyber strategy.

To better understand security readiness, we’ve
identified three distinct security posture maturity
zones (Figure 2. Also see "About the research" for
methodology details), assessed across two critical
dimensions: cyber strategy—the ability to design and
execute risk strategies—and cyber capability—the
technical proficiency to apply Zero Trust, enhance
resilience and secure cyber-physical systems at scale.
The results are stark. Only 10% occupy the coveted
Reinvention-Ready Zone, demonstrating both robust
security capabilities and integrated cyber strategy.

Around 27% fall into the Progressing Zone—showing
cybersecurity strong on strategy but lacking in
implementation (24%) or strong on protection
but lacking strategic alignment (3%). And the vast
majority, a worrying 63%, languish in the Exposed
Zone, lacking both strategy and capability, making
them prime targets for cyber threats. Looking at the
strategy and capability dimensions separately, 34%
of organizations demonstrate a strong cyber strategy
through intensified practices, and just 13% possess
the robust protection and resilience needed to truly
weather the storm[^29].

![Figure 2: Security Posture Maturity: Moving from Exposed to Reinvention-Ready Zone. The diagram shows a matrix with Cyber Strategy on the Y-axis (Strong cyber strategies at the top) and Cyber Capability on the X-axis (Strong cyber capabilities on the right). Three zones are depicted: Exposed Zone (bottom left, 63%), Progressing Zone (top left, 24% - strong strategy, weak capability; and bottom right, 3% - weak strategy, strong capability), and Reinvention-Ready Zone (top right, 10%). Descriptions for each zone are provided.]

## The race to AI adoption, coupled with talent shortages, is outpacing security

The rapid adoption of AI, coupled
with a severe cybersecurity talent
shortage, presents a significant
security challenge. While
awareness of AI-related risks
is increasing, security measures
are simply not keeping pace.

Organizations are prioritizing speed and innovation
over security, often treating it as an afterthought
in the race to integrate AI. This translates to a
dangerous pattern: security controls are frequently
omitted from initial planning phases, forcing teams
into costly and inefficient retrofitting. Spending on
generative AI initiatives is significantly outpacing
investments in securing generative AI. From 2023
to 2024, spending on gen AI initiatives was 1.6
times higher than budgets that were allocated
for security, and by 2025 this gap is expected to
widen to 2.6 times (Figure 3). This growing disparity
underscores the disconnect between innovation
and protection. In essence, companies are building

AI systems on insecure foundations, exposing
themselves to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
This reactive approach is unsustainable, with only
28% of companies embedding security controls
in all transformation initiatives from the start[^30]
and less than half (just 42%) are balancing their AI
development with the essential security investments
needed to protect those systems[^31].

This challenge is further compounded by a
critical cybersecurity talent shortage, with 83%
of executives identifying it as a major obstacle to
achieving a strong security posture[^32].

![Figure 3: Generative AI spend vs. security spend. Spending on generative AI initiatives is outpacing investments in securing generative AI. The bar chart shows Gen AI spend as % of IT spend and Cybersecurity budget allocated to securing gen AI initiatives for 2023, 2024, and 2025. The gap between Gen AI spend and security budget is shown as 1.6X in 2024 and 2.6X in 2025.]

## The Reinvention-Ready Zone advantage—where security fuels success

Companies in the Reinvention-Ready Zone
demonstrate a significant advantage. Compared to
those in the Exposed Zone, they are 69% less likely
to experience advanced attacks such as AI-powered
cyberattacks and have a 1.5 times higher success
rate in blocking attacks. This translates to greater
operational visibility, with Reinvention-Ready Zone
companies achieving 1.3 times higher visibility across
their IT and OT infrastructure[^33].

The benefits of this zone extend beyond security,
driving significant business value. These firms achieve
1.6 times higher ROI on their generative AI initiatives,
demonstrating that embedding security from the start
fuels both resilience and financial success.

![Figure 4: Advantage of security investments. Increasing investments in security posture practices to reach the Reinvention-Ready Zone builds resilience, empowering companies to stay ahead of threats. The chart shows the percentage reduction in Material cyber threat incidents and Minor cyber incidents for Progressing Zone (-11% material, -7% minor) and Reinvention-Ready Zone (-13% material, -14% minor) compared to the Exposed Zone (0%).]

Furthermore, their robust security practices
contribute to a 1.7 times reduction in technical debt,
paving the way for more efficient and sustainable
innovation. And perhaps most critically, strong
cybersecurity builds trust. Reinvention-Ready Zone
companies see a 1.6 times greater improvement
in customer trust—a vital ingredient for long-term
business success[^34].

Progressing to this zone requires a commitment to
enhancing security posture maturity. Our economic
modeling underscores a compelling financial
benefit: a 10% increase in security investment boosts
an Exposed Zone firm's ability to detect, contain and
remediate cyber threats by 14% (Figure 4)[^35].

By prioritizing security alongside AI advancements,
businesses can not only stay ahead of the ever-
evolving threat landscape but also unlock the full,
transformative potential of AI.

## Four actions to strengthen AI security

The rise of AI, particularly generative AI,
presents both opportunities and challenges
for security. While AI can enhance security,
it also introduces new risks and expands the
attack surface. Companies must take four
decisive actions to protect AI investments
and leverage AI's defensive capabilities:

01 Develop and deploy a fit-for-
purpose security governance
framework and operating model
accounting for the realities of an
AI-disrupted world to establish
clear accountability and align
AI security with regulatory and
business objectives.

02 Design a digital core to be
generative AI secure from
the onset by embedding
security into AI development,
deployment and operational
processes from the outset.

03 Maintain resilient AI systems
with secure foundations that
proactively address emerging
threats, enhance detection
capabilities, enable AI-model
testing and improve
response mechanisms.

04 Reinvent cybersecurity
with generative AI by
leveraging it to automate
security processes,
strengthen cyber defenses
and detect threats sooner.

### Action 01_ Built for protection

Developing and deploying fit-for-purpose
security in an AI-disrupted world

Cyber threats are escalating, with
72% of organizations reporting
an increase in attacks and 63%
identifying the evolving threat
landscape as their biggest
challenge[^36]. CISOs must move
beyond reactive security as
generative AI amplifies risks.
Here are three actions resilient
companies are taking now.

Make AI security a C-Suite priority with
accountability and collaboration

AI security isn’t just an IT issue; it’s a business
imperative that requires executive-level
accountability. CISOs must work closely with
the CEO, AI leadership and board to drive clear
ownership of AI security and cyber resilience.
Organizations in the Reinvention-Ready Zone lead
the way, with 73% ensuring board-level cybersecurity
accountability, embedding security into strategic
decision-making[^37]. Build a compelling business case
for AI security by positioning it as an enabler of
innovation, compliance and competitive advantage—
not a constraint.

Foster collaboration across business and AI teams
to ensure generative AI systems remain secure
while navigating evolving risks and regulations.

Security teams must align with business objectives,
while business leaders must recognize security as
essential to success. Bridging this gap requires clear,
jargon-free communication, showing how measures
like multi-factor authentication and data encryption,
for example, create safer, more transparent customer
experiences. Security shouldn’t be a hurdle—it
should be a competitive advantage, integrated into
marketing, customer interactions and brand trust.

Embed AI security into every strategic decision,
from product launches to M&A, ensuring innovation
doesn’t introduce unmanageable risks. 85% of
organizations in the Reinvention-Ready Zone align
cybersecurity with business strategy and integrate
security into digital transformation from the start—
compared to just 45% in the Exposed Zone[^38].

Establish shared security performance metrics
early in product development and service delivery.
Go beyond speed and functionality—measure
how effectively security is incorporated by design,
tracking the percentage of security requirements
addressed in initial design phases, post-launch
vulnerabilities and patch deployment times.
Ensure executive leadership reviews AI security
metrics alongside business KPIs, embedding risk
considerations into strategic decision-making.
By making AI security a board-level priority, fostering
collaboration and embedding security into strategic
initiatives, organizations can turn AI security into a
business enabler—driving resilience, trust and long-
term success.

Build an adaptive AI risk and compliance framework

AI regulations are evolving at lightning speed, so
organizations need a flexible, forward-looking
approach to AI security. Establish an adaptive AI
security framework that goes beyond merely meeting
compliance requirements; it should continuously
evolve to tackle emerging threats like adversarial
attacks, data poisoning and model manipulation.
Reinvention-Ready Zone organizations excel in this
area, with 87% defining AI-specific policies for data
security, privacy and access control, alongside clear
governance and compliance controls[^39].

Maintaining agility requires continuous learning.
Regular AI risk management training enables teams
to anticipate and respond to evolving threats. Assign
clear oversight roles to prevent breaches, ethical
issues and AI-specific risks, and regularly update
Responsible AI practices based on lessons learned
from real-world attacks, internal audits, regulatory
feedback, and to address new challenges.

Finally, integrating AI risk assessments into
procurement, vendor management and product
development allows organizations to identify
vulnerabilities early. A real-time, adaptive approach
strengthens security while enabling innovation—
ensuring resilience in an ever-changing regulatory
and threat landscape.

To stay resilient in a fractured geopolitical
environment, organizations should ensure their
cybersecurity frameworks are flexible enough to
account for changes in sourcing models, data
flows and cross-border operations. This includes
regularly assessing how shifting trade policies,
tariffs and regional tensions affect regulatory
obligations, data residency requirements and
third-party exposure. For multi-country operations,
the cybersecurity operating model should be
reviewed and updated to reflect region-specific
risks—ensuring security controls, reporting lines
and compliance practices are responsive to local
threats and political conditions.

Strengthen human risk awareness
to close the security gap

Technology alone won’t secure AI—people
remain the first line of defense. As deepfakes,
AI-powered phishing and identity fraud become
more sophisticated, social engineering attacks
increasingly bypass traditional security controls.
Reinvention-Ready Zone organizations recognize
this, with 75% implementing structured
