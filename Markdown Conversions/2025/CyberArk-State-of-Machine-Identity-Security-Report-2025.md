# Organizations Are Leaning Hard into Machine Identity Security
Machine identity security is rapidly becoming one of the most critical aspects of modern 
cybersecurity strategies. While CISOs and IT leaders recognize its importance, many are 
still struggling to build a cohesive approach to protect these digital credentials. Machine 
identities play a unique and foundational role in both modern and traditional systems, 
connecting devices, applications, APIs and cloud native technologies securely. However, 
as their use continues to expand, so does the complexity of managing them effectively.
Machine identities now outnumber human identities by an overwhelming margin. This 
sheer scale is driven by several factors, including the rise of cloud native technologies, 
artificial intelligence (AI) and the shrinking lifespans of machine credentials in today’s 
fast-paced development cycles. Each instance requires a unique identity to authenticate 
and communicate securely, adding to the already staggering growth in machine 
identities—particularly as organizations begin to embrace agentic AI.
At the same time, malicious actors have taken notice, and cybercriminals are targeting 
machine identities as entry points for attacks. And machine identity attacks are 
growing. By exploiting weaknesses in authentication systems or leveraging expired or 
mismanaged credentials, attackers can move laterally within networks, access sensitive 
data and disrupt critical operations. The increasing reliance on machine identities 
magnifies their risks, making them a prime focus for threat actors seeking to undermine 
enterprise security.
To better understand how these challenges are impacting today’s enterprise security, 
we surveyed 1,200 security leaders across the USA, UK, Australia, France, Germany and 
Singapore. Read on to learn the findings.

# Machine Identities Increasingly Vulnerable to Compromise
Due in large to their widespread usage, under-managed machine identities 
have become more and more vulnerable, with 77% of security leaders 
acknowledging that every undiscovered machine identity is a potential point 
of compromise. Among the most concerning assets vulnerable to compromise 
are API keys and SSL/TLS certificates, with SSH keys, code signing 
certificates and mobile certificates following close behind. It’s no surprise 
that this list is for the most part consistent with the list of machine identities 
that are perceived as difficult to secure. 

![Text: Machine Identities Increasingly Vulnerable to Compromise. 77% feel that every undiscovered machine identity is a potential point of compromise.]

![Chart: Top Machine Identities Involved in a Security Incident. API keys: 34%, SSH certificates: 28%, IoT certificates: 34%, SSL/TLS certificates: 27%, Service account tokens: 29%, Secrets: 20%.]

Machine Identities Increasingly Vulnerable to Compromise
Alarmingly, 50% of organizations reported security breaches linked to 
compromised machine identities in the past year. As anticipated, API keys and 
SSL/TLS certificates topped the list as primary contributors to incidents. And the 
business impact of these breaches is significant, with 51% reporting delays in 
application launches, 44% suffering outages that hurt customer experience and 
43% experiencing unauthorized access to sensitive data or networks. Compliance 
violations and diminished developer productivity further compound the damage.

![Text: 50% of organizations reported security incidents or breaches that are related to compromised machine identities in the last year.]

![Chart: Business Impact of Machine Identity-Related Security Incidents. Cost time and resources due to delaying an application launch/slowing down production: 51%, Caused an outage or disruption that negatively impacted customer experience: 44%, Attackers were able to gain unauthorized access to data, networks and systems: 43%, Led to a compliance violation and/or audit failure: 33%, Negatively impacted developer experience: 29%.]

In addition to compromises, certificate-related outages are especially 
prevalent, with 72% of organizations experiencing at least one in the last 
year—and 34% suffering multiple. Certificate-related outages prevent 
access to business-critical systems, causing severe operational disruption. 
Alarmingly, the frequency of such incidents is on the rise, with 67% reporting 
monthly outages (up from 26% in 2022) and 45% grappling with weekly 
disruptions (up from 12%).

![Chart: Rising Frequency of Certificate-Related Outages. Monthly outages: 2022: 26%, 2025: 67%. Weekly outages: 2022: 12%, 2025: 45%.]

# Spotlight: AI Looms Large on the Machine Identity Threat Horizon
The rise of AI has elevated the urgency of securing machine identities, with 
81% of security leaders emphasizing its critical role in protecting AI’s future. 
Machine identities act as the gatekeepers, helping shield AI models and 
systems from threats like unauthorized access, model and data theft,  
and manipulation.
A notable 79% of respondents agree that protecting AI models from 
compromise demands robust machine identity and stringent authentication 
and authorization protocols. This focus reflects a growing awareness of 
how susceptible AI systems can be to exploitation. Manipulated models 
can generate harmful outputs, while stolen algorithms could endanger 
proprietary innovation and competitive advantage.
Looking ahead, 72% of leaders predict a shift in priorities, moving from safely 
utilizing generative AI to directly safeguarding the models themselves. This 
transition acknowledges the inherent risks of leaving such valuable assets 
vulnerable in a constantly evolving threat landscape.

![Text: Spotlight: AI Looms Large on the Machine Identity Threat Horizon. Believe machine identity will be a vital element of securing the future of AI: 81%, Believe the need to secure AI models from manipulation and theft is putting greater emphasis on the need for machine identity, authentication and authorization: 79%, Believe the focus for next year will shift from using generative AI (GenAI) safely to protecting the models themselves from manipulation and theft: 72%.]

# Machine Identities Growing Faster than Human Identities
One of the reasons that machine identity vulnerabilities are becoming more 
commonplace is that there are simply more machine identities than ever—
and that means more points of potential failure. The number of machine 
identities is growing exponentially, outpacing human identities and reshaping 
enterprise security priorities. It’s not surprising that 79% of organizations 
expect the number of machine identities to grow over the next year, with 63% 
projecting increases of up to 50% and 16% anticipating more aggressive 
growth between 50-150% per year. 
With machines already radically outnumbering humans in organizations, the 
growing disparity is clear. Cloud native technologies, AI and microservices 
drive this rapid growth, as workloads and containers spin up dynamically, 
often lasting minutes rather than years. Each instance demands unique 
identities to operate securely, adding to the growing complexity of machine 
identity security.

![Text: Machine Identities Growing Faster than Human Identities. 79% expect an increase in machine identities of up to 150% over the next 12 months.]

![Text: Project radical growth of 50-150%: 16%. Expect an increase by up to 50%: 63%.]

Despite their overwhelming numbers and critical roles, only 23% of organizations prioritize securing 
machine identities exclusively—while 30% focus on human identities. Even though 47% treat 
machine and human identities as equal priorities, “equal” attention doesn’t necessarily reflect the 
growing scale or importance of machine identities.
The surge in machine identities is undeniable, and elevating their security as a core priority is 
essential for safeguarding enterprise operations.

# Value of Machine Identity Security Lauded, But Largely Untapped
Overall, machine identity security is widely recognized as critical, with 92% of security 
leaders reporting some form of a machine identity security program. Yet, this broad 
adoption doesn’t always equate to maturity. Many organizations face significant obstacles 
in delivering effective protection for their machine identities. Nearly 42% of security 
leaders admit their organizations lack a cohesive machine identity security strategy 
across environments, business units and machine identity types.

![Text: Value of Machine Identity Security Lauded, But Largely Untapped. 23% prioritize securing machine identities exclusively. 42% lack a cohesive machine identity security strategy.]

Other challenges are just as pressing—37% struggle to adapt to shorter 
machine identity lifecycles, while the same percentage worry about 
adversaries misusing stolen identities to execute attacks such as privilege 
escalation, malicious updates or man-in-the-middle exploits. Another 36% 
express concerns about expired certificates that lead to service disruptions 
and outages. Furthermore, 34% lack visibility into secrets stored in vaults, 
and 33% cannot promptly identify and revoke compromised identities, leaving 
them vulnerable to attacks.

![Text: Top Machine Identity Security Concerns. Lack a cohesive machine identity security strategy: 42%, Challenged to adapt to shorter machine identity lifecycles: 37%, Worried about adversaries using stolen machine identities to send malicious updates, escalate privileges, perform man-in-the-middle attacks and more: 37%, Concerned about expired certificates leading to service disruptions and outages: 36%, Lack visibility into secrets stored in vaults: 34%, Can’t quickly find and revoke compromised identities that leave them exposed: 33%, Can’t centrally and consistently manage all machine identities according to policy: 32%, Unable to regularly rotate and secure all secrets: 32%, Can’t manage and secure machine identities at the workload level: 30%, Worried about failing an audit due to an incomplete machine identity inventory: 26%.]

To complicate matters further, ownership of machine identity security remains 
fragmented. While 53% of security teams assume responsibility for preventing 
compromises, development (28%) and platform teams (14%) are still heavily 
involved. Similarly, other tasks such as managing certificates or creating policies 
are divided among teams, creating inefficiencies and gaps in management.

# Machine Identity Security Becoming More Complex to Manage
The expansion of digital ecosystems has dramatically expanded the 
complexity of managing machine identity security. Organizations now contend 
with a wide variety of machine identities, each requiring robust protection. 
Leading the list of the most challenging assets to secure are API keys (36%) 
and SSL/TLS certificates (34%), followed by IoT certificates, SSH keys, mobile 
certificates and secrets. 

![Text: Security’s Most Challenging Machine Identity Types. 36% API keys, 34% SSL/TLS certificates, 33% IoT certificates, 27% SSH keys and certificates, 26% Mobile certificates.]

Compounding this complexity is the sheer volume and velocity of machine 
identities, which are rapidly growing as organizations adopt cloud native 
technologies and IoT devices at scale. Protecting these machine identities 
is no small task. Key challenges are split pretty evenly, including the 
ability to quickly revoke and replace certificates, identifying who controls 
access to applications or devices using a machine identity, pinpointing 
the locations or applications where machine identities are in use, 
maintaining accurate inventories and determining who is authorized to 
access these identities.

![Text: Security’s Machine Identity Challenges. 38% Quickly revoking and replacing machine identities, 38% Identifying the business group or administrator who controls access to the application or device using the machine identity, 37% Identifying the location or application where the machine identity is in use, 36% Gaining an accurate inventory of machine identities, 35% Understanding who is authorized to access and use the machine identity.]

Despite the rising stakes, automation remains underutilized. Given the 
nature of today’s modern networks, an alarming 34% of organizations still 
use manual or non-automated methods to manage their machine identity 
lifecycles. This limits visibility, increases risks and slows response times  
to potential threats.

![Text: 34% still use manual or non-automated methods to manage machine identity lifecycles.]

# Machine Identity Security Challenges Will Only Intensify Over Time
Aside from the emerging challenges of securing agentic AI, the future of machine 
identity security will be fraught with complex challenges, driven by major shifts such 
as certificate authority (CA) distrust events, shrinking certificate lifespans and the 
rise of quantum computing. Alarmingly, 71% of security leaders worry their CA could 
become untrusted at any time, and 46% fear the need for immediate reaction without 
adequate preparedness.
Shrinking certificate lifespans add to the strain, with 23% of teams concerned about 
Apple’s plan to reduce public TLS certificate validity to 47 days by 2028—a drastic 
change that would require nearly nine times as many rotations and renewals. Over half of 
organizations already struggle to manage certificates with the current 398-day lifespan, 
with 51% recently experiencing critical outages due to expired TLS certificates.
Quantum computing also looms large in the minds of security leaders, with 57% 
acknowledging its threat to all machine identities. Yet, 31% of teams admit they cannot 
track all identities, leaving gaps in security, while 30% feel it’s already too late to begin 
the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.

![Text: Top Future Machine Identity Concerns. Certificate Authority Distrust: worry that their CA could be untrusted at any time: 71%, Quantum Readiness: regard quantum as the most seismic future change, as it impacts all machine identities: 58%, Shorter Certificate Lifespans: struggle to rotate and renew current TLS certificates and feel totally unprepared for shorter certificate lifecycles: 52%.]

# Spotlight: Cloud Native Machine Identities Getting More Attention in Security Strategies
As we’ve highlighted before, attackers are zeroing in on machine identities, with 74% of 
security leaders worried that cloud native and development environments are becoming 
prime targets. The rapid adoption of both cloud native and AI technologies is further 
compounding the complexity of managing machine identities, amplifying the risks 
associated with protecting these critical assets.
The sheer scale and dynamic nature of cloud native environments present a unique 
challenge. With workloads spinning up and down in seconds, static and centralized 
management of machine identities falls short. Recognizing this, 73% of organizations 
are focusing on shifting towards a more distributed approach to managing and securing 
machine identities at the workload level. This shift ensures that even the most ephemeral 
environments have identities safeguarded in real-time.

![Text: Spotlight: Cloud Native Machine Identities Getting More Attention in Security Strategies. Say attackers are zeroing in on machine identities in cloud native and development environments: 74%, Say the rapid adoption of cloud native technologies and AI are fueling complexity and increasing risks associated with machine identities: 74%, Say they are shifting to a more distributed way of managing and securing machine identities at the workload level: 73%.]

# Focus on Machine Identities Is Increasing, But Not Fast Enough
Most organizations recognize the critical role of machine identities in securing systems and 
data, with 92% working under a machine identity security program and 44% planning to 
expand their use as a key component of their cybersecurity strategies. However, the pace of 
progress may not be sufficient to counteract emerging threats.
Automation is surfacing as a top priority, with 43% of respondents focusing on its 
deployment to handle the rising complexity introduced by shorter certificate lifespans. 
Managing certificates dynamically through automated processes will be essential for 
maintaining security without compromising business efficiency.
Visibility remains another critical challenge, with 39% reporting plans to improve oversight 
of all machine identities. Without clear insight into existing identities, gaps  
and blind spots can quickly turn into vulnerabilities. 
To underscore the growing emphasis on safeguarding AI assets from manipulation or theft, 
39% plan to explore how machine identities can further protect Large Language Models 
(LLMs). Meanwhile, 35% of organizations are beginning to address the looming threat of 
quantum computing by preparing migration plans toward quantum-resistant encryption.
On the cloud native front, 34% see the need to secure machine identities at the workload 
level as an inevitable step to meet the demands of dynamic cloud native environments. 
These priorities reflect a growing awareness of the risks tied to machine identities, but they 
also expose gaps. 

![Text: Future Plans for Machine Identity Security. Plan to increase the use of machine identities to better secure systems and data: 44%, Will deploy more automation to enable the adoption of shorter certificate lifespans: 43%, Want to increase visibility over their machine identities: 39%, Plan to investigate how they can use machine identities to better protect their LLMs: 39%, Will create a plan for migrating to new quantum-resistant encryption: 35%, Plan to investigate how they can use machine identities to better protect their LLMs: 34%.]

# Why Machine Identity Security Programs Lack Maturity and Need to Be Programmatically Strengthened
Let’s not forget that machine identities outnumber human identities by orders of 
magnitude, making them an undeniable priority for every organization. With the 
rapid adoption of cloud native technologies, AI advancements and the shift toward 
shorter certificate lifespans, the reliance on machine identities will only continue to 
grow. This surge brings not only operational complexity but also greater risk.
Cybercriminals are acutely aware of these trends and are targeting machine 
identities to exploit vulnerabilities, compromise systems and disrupt critical 
infrastructure. Many organizations remain vulnerable with weak links in visibility, 
automation and preparedness. From cloud native workloads to quantum 
cryptography, gaps in machine identity security can leave even the most advanced 
organizations dangerously exposed.
The solution lies in establishing a comprehensive machine identity security 
program. Such a program must prioritize automation to meet the demands of 
dynamic environments, visibility to avoid blind spots and crypto agility to prepare 
for emerging threats like quantum computing. These foundational elements not 
only prevent attacks but also ensure the availability of critical systems, letting 
organizations scale securely and innovate with confidence.
