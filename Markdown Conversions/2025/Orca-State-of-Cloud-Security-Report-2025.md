## Foreword

Cloud security has reached a critical turning point. As organizations increasingly rely on the cloud to accelerate innovation and growth, several converging trends are reshaping the challenges security teams face—and the strategies they need to stay ahead.

Multi-cloud adoption is now the norm, with **55%** of organizations using two or more providers. While this offers greater ﬂexibility and resiliency, it also makes it harder to maintain consistent visibility and coverage across environments. At the same time, AI adoption is increasing—**84%** of organizations now use AI in the cloud. But this innovation comes with new risks: **62%** of organizations have at least one vulnerable AI package, and some of the most prevalent AI-related CVEs enable remote code execution.

Traditional risks haven’t gone away either—they’ve intensiﬁed. Nearly a third of cloud assets are in a neglected state, signaling ongoing challenges with monitoring and prioritization.

As organizations store more sensitive data in the cloud, the prevalence of data exposure is rising: **38%** of organizations with sensitive data in their databases also have those databases exposed to the public.

These are among the many challenges covered in this report, which highlight the Defender’s Paradox in cloud security: attackers need to be right only once, defenders every time. In fact, **13%** of organizations have a single cloud asset that supports more than 1,000 attack paths—underscoring the importance of comprehensive detection and effective prioritization.

This report is designed to help teams close their security gaps. Combining real-world insights compiled by the Orca Research Pod, it offers practical guidance on where to focus, what to prioritize, and how to effectively secure multi-cloud environments in the age of AI. We hope this report serves as a valuable resource for your teams.

## Executive Summary

Leveraging unique insights into current and emerging cloud risks captured from the Orca Cloud Security Platform, this report reveals the most commonly found, yet dangerous, cloud security risks. Summarizing the results from our research, these are our main ﬁndings:

- **More cloud innovation brings greater cloud risk.**
  As cloud adoption and cloud-native technologies expand, so does the volume and severity of cloud risks. Nearly a third of cloud assets are neglected today, and each asset contains on average 115 vulnerabilities. Both are two data points among many others illustrating this troubling trend.
- **Attack surfaces are expanding—and risks are increasingly interconnected.**
  76% of organizations have at least one public-facing asset that enables lateral movement, turning a single risk into an opportunity for broader compromise. Security teams not only need to defend a growing attack surface, but increasingly interconnected risks. To illustrate, 36% of organizations have at least one cloud asset supporting more than 100 attack paths—giving attackers a direct route to endanger high-value assets.
- **Risks span the entire application pipeline.**
  Cloud security risks aren't conﬁned to runtime environments—they often originate earlier in the application development lifecycle. 85% of organizations have plaintext secrets embedded in their source code repositories. If a repository is exposed, attackers can extract the secrets to access systems, exﬁltrate data, and more. Oversights such as these can compound risk across the cloud ecosystem.
- **Innovation is expanding attack surfaces—and the scale of cloud risks.**
  84% of organizations are now using AI in the cloud, introducing new risks, including AI-related CVEs that enable remote code execution. Kubernetes adoption adds further complexity—93% of organizations have at least one privileged service account, increasing the potential of a breach. Combined with growing multi-cloud adoption, these trends are reshaping the nature and scale of cloud security challenges.

## Key Findings

- **13%** of organizations have a single cloud asset responsible for creating more than 1000 attack paths.
  Attack paths represent the toxic risk combinations that attackers can exploit to endanger your high-value cloud assets. When detected, attack paths help security teams prioritize risks, reduce alert fatigue, and maximize productivity.
- **38%** of organizations with sensitive data in their databases also have those databases exposed to the public.
  The exposure of sensitive data—including PII, PHI, ﬁnancial records, secrets, and more—continues to rise as organizations store more critical information in the cloud.
- **115** vulnerabilities on average per cloud asset.
  The average number of vulnerabilities per cloud asset is signiﬁcant, especially considering a broader surge in vulnerability exploitation across cloud environments.
- **58%** of organizations have at least one vulnerability older than 20 years.
  For the ﬁrst time, a majority of organizations are contending with vulnerabilities that have lingered for more than two decades.
- **32%** of cloud assets on average are in a neglected state.
  Nearly one in three assets either run unsupported operating systems or have gone unpatched for over 180 days, providing soft targets for attackers to gain access, move laterally, and escalate attacks.
- **76%** of organizations have at least one cloud asset that is public-facing and enables lateral movement.
  Assets exposed to the Internet and connected internally create critical pathways for attackers to escalate privileges and reach high-value targets within the environment.
- **85%** of organizations have plaintext secrets embedded in their source code repositories.
  Secrets stored in source code pose a major risk. If repositories are exposed through breaches or misconﬁgurations, attackers can harvest these credentials to inﬁltrate systems, steal data, or move laterally.
- **93%** of organizations have at least one privileged Kubernetes service account.
  Over-privileged Kubernetes service accounts, if compromised, can be exploited to access sensitive data, escalate privileges, or disrupt workloads across the cluster.

## General Cloud Usage

While cloud adoption continues to accelerate, the market remains highly concentrated around AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), respectively. Each maintains signiﬁcant enterprise adoption, led by AWS. Yet the percentages shown in the corresponding table also underscore the notable yet well-established trend toward multi-cloud adoption.

In fact, this year’s analysis ﬁnds that most organizations are now multi-cloud by design, with **55%** leveraging two or more cloud providers. This marks a signiﬁcant increase from the **12%** of organizations that self-reported deploying multiple clouds in our 2024 Cloud Security Strategies Survey Report, an independent analysis conducted by Gatepoint Research.

What’s driving the multi-cloud demand? Other studies point to an interest in capitalizing on provider specialization—including AI services—and building resilience against potential service disruptions and vendor lock-in.

# AI SECURITY

## AI Security

### GENERAL USAGE & RELATED CVEs

Demand for cloud AI services continues to surge as organizations look to enhance innovation and operations. This year’s report illustrates overall AI adoption in the cloud, the popularity of managed and unmanaged AI services, AI adoption by cloud provider, and the most popular AI packages.

Readers of our 2024 State of AI Security Report understand the related cloud risks of AI adoption, a reality that prevails today. In fact, **62%** of organizations have at least one vulnerable AI package in their cloud environment.

The data below lists the most prevalent CVEs associated with AI packages deployed in cloud environments. Two of them, CVE-2024-39705 and CVE-2025-32434, can allow remote code execution and await NVD enrichment at the time of this writing. This points to the need for better detection, prioritization, and remediation of AI-related vulnerabilities.

# ATTACK PATHS

## Attack Paths

Attack paths represent the toxic risk combinations that attackers can exploit to endanger your high-value cloud assets (i.e., crown jewels). Attack paths reveal how seemingly isolated risks—like an exposed storage bucket or an over-permissioned identity—can be chained together to exploit resources such as sensitive data, admin-level IAM roles, or critical infrastructure components. They enable security teams to prioritize the risks that matter most, reducing alert fatigue while maximizing resource efﬁciency and productivity.

The corresponding graphs reveal the most common crown jewels in cloud environments, as well as the distribution of organizations that have a cloud asset supporting more than 100 attack paths. The latter represents a key asset for security teams to prioritize for remediation, since remediating its associated risks can not only break an attack path, but many of them.

Thirteen percent of organizations have a cloud asset responsible for creating more than 1000 attack paths, with the most toxic asset in our dataset responsible for 165,142 attack paths.

# DATA EXPOSURE

## Data Exposure

### THE BURDEN OF SENSITIVE DATA

Sensitive data—which includes PII, PHI, API keys, ﬁnancial information, secrets, and more—pose a signiﬁcant risk when publicly exposed, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access, data theft, compliance violations, and other severe security incidents.

According to our analysis, sensitive data exposure is prevalent across storage buckets, databases, and cloud functions. While the reasons may vary, multiple studies show that organizations are not just storing more data in the cloud, but sensitive data.

This naturally follows the continued increase in cloud adoption and cloud-native applications. Through 2026, Gartner predicts that 70% of organizations will increase their cloud spending with specialty cloud providers to support their business needs.

The growth of cloud data and storage expands the attack surface for organizations and makes it more attractive to attackers. Threat actors prize sensitive data, especially at a time when the demand for data continues to increase amid AI innovation. It underscores a troubling trend that calls for more attention on data security.

- **33%** of organizations with publicly exposed storage buckets have sensitive data in them.
- **38%** organizations with sensitive data in their databases also have those databases exposed to the public.
- **28%** of organizations with cloud functions have publicly accessible functions with plaintext secrets in the function’s code package and environment variables.

### THE BURDEN OF SENSITIVE DATA

Healthcare is the industry most susceptible to sensitive data exposure for databases—an alarming fact for organizations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), for example, regulates the privacy of protected health information (PHI) in the US, and can impose ﬁnes up to $1.5 million (USD) for violations depending on culpability. Yet the risk appears to affect a signiﬁcant proportion of organizations across all industries.

![Bar chart showing the percentage of organizations in different industries affected by sensitive data exposure risks. Industries include Healthcare, Media, Consumer and Manufacturing, Technology, Public Sector, Finance, Retail, and Other. Risks shown are: % of organizations with publicly exposed storage buckets have sensitive data in them, % of organizations with sensitive data in their databases also have those databases exposed to the public, and % of organizations with public-facing cloud functions that contains plaintext secrets in its code packages & environment variables.](null)

# VULNERABILITIES

## Vulnerabilities

### 4.1 VULNERABILITIES - A TIMELESS CHALLENGE

Vulnerabilities predate the cloud as a top concern for security leaders and teams. Yet, year-after-year, they sustain their relevance—with this year no exception. Our analysis shows that the average cloud asset carries a signiﬁcant number of vulnerabilities that security teams must contend with.

In fact, cloud assets on average have **115** vulnerabilities. This represents a signiﬁcant number when we consider that vulnerability exploitation continues to increase.

According to VulnCheck, the number of CVEs exploited and publicly disclosed rose 20% YoY in 2024, totaling 768 CVEs. Findings from the 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report also show an increase in vulnerability exploitation (34%), making it the second most popular initial access vector for breaches and partly responsible for one-ﬁfth of the data breaches publicly disclosed in 2024.

- **115** The average number of vulnerabilities per cloud asset

### 4.2 UNPATCHED WEB SERVICES

Web services are applications that are able to send or receive communication over a network, whether internal or the public Internet. They provide a way to communicate, connect, and use an application over a network. Unpatched services, with known vulnerabilities and bugs, can be one of the main attack vectors into your system. Malicious actors can exploit an unpatched vulnerability or bug to cause service downtime or a denial of service. In some cases, unauthorized remote access may also be a possibility.

According to our analysis, nearly eight in every 10 organizations have at least one unpatched web service. This remains notable in light of an October 2024 joint Cybersecurity Announcement (CSA) by the FBI, NSA, CNMF, and NCSC-UK. The CSA cautioned organizations about APT29—an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tied to the Russian Federation’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)—targeting software vulnerabilities to gain initial access, escalate privileges, move laterally, persist in environments, and exﬁltrate data.

Targets speciﬁed in the CSA included technology companies, which can fuel supply chain attacks. Notably, a signiﬁcant majority of technology companies in our analysis have at least one unpatched web service, along with healthcare organizations, which also remains a popular target among threat actors. Security teams should ensure that all components of a web service, including the web server and third-party libraries, are up-to-date.

- **82%** of organizations have at least one unpatched web service.
- **87%** of healthcare organizations have at least one unpatched web service.
- **84%** of technology organizations have at least one unpatched web service.

### 4.3 OLD, BUT STILL RELEVANT

There’s a familiar saying: problems don’t go away by themselves. And that’s especially true when it comes to vulnerabilities. In 2024, we saw a slight but important increase in the number of organizations with vulnerabilities at least 10–20 years old. This year marked the ﬁrst time in our analysis that a majority of organizations are now dealing with a vulnerability at least two decades old.

While these risks aren’t new, they deserve attention considering that they’re often well-documented and widely exploited by attackers.

Also notable, most organizations in our dataset still have at least one asset vulnerable to Spring4Shell and Log4Shell, both zero-day vulnerabilities reported in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, nearly a third of cloud assets vulnerable to Log4Shell are public-facing, providing attackers direct access from the Internet.

Clearly, these ﬁndings signal the critical need for better patch management, especially in the context of sophisticated threat groups targeting the least path of resistance to a compromise.

- **93%** of organizations have at least one vulnerability older than 10 years, +2% YoY.
- **58%** of organizations have at least one vulnerability older than 20 years, +12% YoY.
- **59%** of organizations have at least one asset vulnerable to Log4Shell.
- **32%** of cloud assets vulnerable to Log4Shell are public facing.
- **58%** of organizations have at least one asset vulnerable to Spring4Shell.

# NEGLECTED ASSETS

## Neglected Assets

### NEGLECTED BY DEFENDERS, BELOVED BY ATTACKERS

Neglected assets are a prime example of the Defender’s Paradox, which says that defenders have to be right every time when securing their environments, while attackers need only to be right once when attempting to exploit it.

A neglected asset is a cloud asset that uses an unsupported operating system or has remained unpatched for 180 days or more. As applications and operating systems reach EOL, vendors stop offering support, causing security and stability to decrease over time. Neglected assets are a soft target for attackers, which explains why attackers commonly exploit them to gain initial access. Recall the reference to APT29 from the previous chapter. A well-documented TTP (techniques, tactics, and procedures) of the infamous threat group is to target neglected assets, which remain unmonitored and often unpatched.

Based on our analysis, nearly a third of cloud assets are neglected (**32%**), leaving them susceptible to exploitation as they expand organizations’ attack surfaces. The most neglected asset type is virtual machines (**95%** of organizations have at least one), while the most neglected operating system (OS) distribution is Ubuntu (**88%** of organizations have at least one instance). Additionally, our ﬁndings show that more than a ﬁfth of organizations are neglecting at least **40%** of their cloud assets.

- **32%** of cloud assets are in a neglected state on average.
- **+20%** of organizations are neglecting at least 40% of their cloud assets.

Equally troubling, our analysis ﬁnds that nearly nine in every 10 organizations have a neglected asset accessible from the Internet. These assets are often spun up for temporary use and are never secured or turned down. When publicly exposed, they become prime targets for attackers.

- **89%** of organizations have at least one neglected cloud asset that is internet-facing, +7% YoY.

Industries particularly susceptible to public-facing neglected assets include:

- CONSUMER & MANUFACTURING: **97%**
- TECHNOLOGY: **94%**
- PUBLIC SECTOR: **92%**

The prevalence of neglected assets has increased YoY, with nearly every organization and industry affected. This troubling trend is likely to continue as more cloud assets meet the criteria of “neglected” (i.e., unsupported OS or unpatched for a 180 days or more).

# IDENTITY & ACCESS

## Identity & Access

### 6.1 LATERAL MOVEMENT

Considering the “soft targets” explored in the previous chapter, it’s important to look at other ways attackers can gain unauthorized access and move within cloud environments—and execute more ambitious, malicious, and impactful campaigns.

Lateral movement—when attackers leverage a cloud asset to exploit another—represents a key risk that has increased YoY. Lateral movement often allows attackers to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, and compromise high-value assets deeper in the environment.

Cloud assets that enable lateral movement are risky in their own right, yet this risk magniﬁes when those assets are publicly accessible.

- **95%** organizations have at least one cloud asset that enables lateral movement, +5% YoY.
- **76%** of organizations have at least one cloud asset that is public-facing and enables lateral movement, +4% YoY.

### 6.2 CLOUD FUNCTIONS

The adoption of serverless architectures, including cloud functions, continues to increase. Forrester notes growing adoption of "serverless-ﬁrst" approaches, as many organizations want cloud services without the burden of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) deployments.

Serverless computing still presents risks, however. Cloud functions conﬁgured to allow public access can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, service disruptions, or unauthorized resource consumption.

Additionally, cloud functions granted administrative privileges can perform wide-ranging actions across cloud resources. If attackers compromise the function, they can access sensitive data, further escalate privileges, and perform other malicious actions.

- **42%** of organizations have at least one Lambda function that lacks any policies restricting public access, +12% YoY.
- **24%** of organizations have Lambda functions with admin permissions, +5% YoY.
- **77%** of organizations have Lambda functions exposing secrets like API keys or access information.
- **59%** of GCP functions are public and have invoker rights.

### 6.3 NON-HUMAN IDENTITIES

Non-human identities (NHIs) refer to digital identities assigned to machines, services, and automated processes—not human users. These can include service accounts, workload identities, cloud functions, and more. Our analysis ﬁnds that NHIs outnumber their human counterparts by an average of 50:1. NHIs play an important role in cloud and Kubernetes environments, powering critical applications and efﬁcient operations by enabling digital identities to gain the cloud access and permissions they need.

Yet NHIs, when left unsecured, can dramatically increase cloud risks. This is especially true when users grant NHIs more permissions than they need. If attackers compromise the NHI, this can lead to unauthorized access, lateral movement, data loss, and other severe security incidents, whether in cloud or Kubernetes environments.

- **78%** of organizations have at least one IAM role that hasn’t been used for 90+ days, +6% YoY.
- **77%** of organizations with AWS have at least one service account with permissions across two or more accounts.
- **12%** of organizations have at least one permissive role attached to more than 50 instances.

Interestingly, our analysis also uncovers the average age of NHIs by type, with several surpassing the one-year mark. We also see the average remediation days for NHI-related assets, a measure that tracks the life of speciﬁc cloud alerts from open to close. Here, we see that IAM misconﬁguration alerts associated with NHIs take the longest to remediate, followed by data protection and authentication.

![Bar chart showing Average Age of NHI by Type. AWS IAM Instance Profile: 416 days, GCP IAM Service Account: 401 days, AWS IAM Role: 354 days, AliCloud RAM Role: 288 days, Azure Service Principal: 278 days, Azure Tenant Assignment: 244 days, GCP IAM Role: 58 days.](null)

![Bar chart showing Average Remediation Days for NHI-related Risks. IAM Misconfiguration: 337 days, Data Protection: 260 days, Authentication: 208 days, Lateral Movement: 123 days, Suspicious Activity: 93 days.](null)

### 6.4 UNUSED IAM USERS

User credentials are considered unused if they remain active but unused for more than 90 days. While seemingly harmless, it can dramatically increase the attack surface and provide attackers opportunities for unauthorized or backdoor access, lateral movement, and more.

This year’s ﬁndings, compared to last year’s, show a moderate, yet notable increase in unused user credentials. This occurs when access keys or passwords associated with an IAM user remain active despite not being used in over three months. Stale user credentials increase the attack surface. If compromised, they may provide silent backdoor access—especially if not closely monitored.

Organizations should implement automated inactivity detection for unused users, enforce credential rotation policies, and disable or delete unused credentials after a deﬁned threshold (e.g., 60–90 days).

- **89%** of organizations have IAM user credentials that haven’t been used for 90+ days, +7% YoY.

# APPLICATION SECURITY

## Application Security

### 7.1 SECRETS EXPOSURE

According to Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, stolen credentials is the top cause of data breaches for cloud-native applications, contributing to nearly nine out of every 10. Secrets encompass more than just user credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens, access keys), and attackers often ﬁnd and exploit them via code repositories. In fact, past studies by our researchers found that attackers can ﬁ
