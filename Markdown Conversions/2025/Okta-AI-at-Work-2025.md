EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Prepare for
impact: AI is in
the building
Our survey reveals executive sentiment, concerns, and priorities around
artificial intelligence.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has existed since the 1950s, the public
release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 propelled the technology
into the forefront of just about every conversation. AI is featured
everywhere, from newspaper headlines and social media takes to team
stand-ups and board meetings. And that discussion hasn’t quieted.
That’s because every week seems to bring about a new leap in either the
technology itself or how organizations infuse it into their products and
internal systems. But legitimate businesses aren’t the only ones taking
advantage of AI to accelerate innovation, boost efficiency, and ignite
productivity.
Bad actors have also embraced the tech, using it to develop, scale, and
launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. The topic of security and how it
relates to AI is inextricable from any conversation regarding this fast-
moving technology.
In the age of AI, driving a business forward requires balancing three very
significant considerations: growth through innovation, productivity through
operational efficiency, and trust through security. While AI has the potential
to ignite innovation and optimize operational efficiency, it has also
expanded the attack surface.
With so many considerations at play — from AI’s promises to its very real
risks — we wanted to know how leaders in business are navigating the AI
landscape. What are their perceptions of AI, how is AI factoring into their
decisions, and do they feel prepared to leverage its capabilities and protect
against its risks?
To better understand how AI impacts the intersection of security,
innovation, and operational efficiency, we commissioned an AlphaSights
survey of 125 executives across three regions, targeting the decision-
makers typically tasked with helming those efforts at companies:
Responses from these executives offer insights into where companies
across sizes, industries, and regions find themselves in today’s AI
landscape and where they aim to be in the future.
CSOs/CISOs for their focus on security
CTOs for their focus on innovation
CIOs for their focus on operational efficiency

## Key takeaways
Executives reveal sentiments, priorities, and
concerns around AI in the business world
KEY TAKEAWAYS
The executive perspective on AI
The outlook is positive
More than half of executives (58%)
view AI as a positive force in the
world, with nearly one-third (31%)
characterizing their outlook on AI’s
impact as very positive.
Security colors everything
Security isn’t just a top strategic
priority; it’s also the focus of
executives’ near-future
plans. Improving security and
threat detection is the top-
prompted AI-related priority for
leaders in the next 12 months.
Data privacy is a concern
Respondents say data
privacy, followed by security
risks, are top AI concerns.
Identity is more important than
ever
79% of executives view Identity and
Access Management (IAM) as
either important (33%) or very
important (46%) when bringing AI
capabilities to their organization.

## Who we surveyed
WHO WE SURVEYED
Demographics
and strategic
priorities
With a company’s success closely tied to its ability to spark innovation,
expand security, and drive efficiency, we focused our survey on the three
executive roles most closely associated with those initiatives:
Here’s an overview of who we surveyed and their top strategic priorities.
CSOs/CISOs (security)
CTOs (innovation)
CIOs (operational efficiency)
Demographics: Executives span
roles, industries, and regions
We surveyed 125 global executives, including 41% with a CSO or CISO role,
33% with a CTO role, and 26% with a CIO role.
Surveyed executives represent companies in more than 20 industries, led
by technology (30%), finance and banking (14%), and professional
services (11%).
We sought a global perspective for our survey, focusing on three regions:
47% of respondents work for organizations headquartered in the Americas
(AMER); 29% work at businesses headquartered in Europe, the Middle
East, and Africa (EMEA); and 24% work at companies headquartered in
Asia-Pacific (APAC).
Among the executives, 68% work at companies with more than 1,000
employees. The remaining 32% are employed at businesses with fewer
than 999 workers.
Strategic priorities: Security takes top slot
To understand the executive outlook in the AI era, we focused on the
strategic priorities that drive their work. We were curious: Would
respondents gravitate toward one strategic priority?
We asked executives to rank, from most to least important, the following
strategic priorities: security, operational efficiency, innovation, and
speed to market.
Across the board, respondents coalesce around security. Forty-two
percent of all executives surveyed tap security as their top strategic
priority, followed by operational efficiency at 22%.
When broken down by role, however, the survey reveals that executive
groups show a preference for different strategic priorities: security for
CSOs/CISOs, speed to market for CTOs, and operational efficiency for
CIOs.
Leaders at larger companies tend to rank security as their most
important strategic priority. That priority shifts slightly for smaller
companies: Executives at businesses with fewer than 500 employees
distribute their priorities more evenly among operational efficiency,
innovation, and speed to market, with security being less of a focus.
Respondents from the technology industry tend to rank security as their
most important strategic priority, followed by those in finance and
banking and professional services.
Security is the top priority for executives in EMEA and AMER,
while innovation takes the top slot for respondents in APAC.

## Executive AI sentiment
How do executives feel
about AI?
EXECUTIVE AI SENTIMENT
The AI present
and future looks
bright
Despite the very real risks associated with AI, particularly its impact
on the threat landscape, executives express optimism about the
technology.
When asked to indicate their outlook on AI on a five-point scale
ranging from very positive to very negative, executives report
viewing AI as much more of a positive force in the world than a
negative one.
That optimism is most pronounced in EMEA, where 39% of executives say
they have a very positive outlook on AI’s impact on the world. They’re
followed by 29% of AMER respondents and 27% of APAC executives.
When it comes to AI becoming a bigger part of daily life, 46% of executives
say they feel equal parts concern and excitement.
This suggests respondents recognize AI’s potential benefits and risks.
When combined with the 44% of executives whose excitement outweighs
their concern, the data indicates many executives see some benefit from
AI’s increased prevalence.

## AI understanding and acumen
What are
executives’
levels
of AI
understanding
and acumen?
AI UNDERSTANDING AND ACUMEN
Executives show
healthy AI
understanding,
confidence levels
They aren’t called “decision-makers” for nothing. Each day,
executives are inundated with decisions big and small, with
more and more of those calls likely connected to AI.
Knowledge influences decision-making, so establishing
respondents’ familiarity with AI was key to better
understanding their priorities, concerns, and decision-
making confidence.
Which statement best describes your level
of understanding about artificial intelligence?
Expert: I hold a graduate degree in Computer Science,
and I have research experience in AI R&D.
Advanced: I have experience implementing AI models
from scratch. I am technically fluent in one or more
subdomains of AI, such as Machine Learning, Data
Mining, or Reinforcement Learning.
Intermediate: I am familiar with the technical aspects
of one or more subdomains of AI. I may have
implemented an AI system using API calls.
Novice: I have used AI systems, and I have a non-
technical understanding of their functioning, such as
what they can do, their biases, safety, or limitations.
Fundamental Awareness: I am aware when a software
uses AI, but I am not familiar with any technical or non-
technical aspects of it, such as biases, safety, or
limitations.
Most respondents (43%) assess their understanding of AI as intermediate,
and another 37% self-assess as advanced. Only 14% of executives report
having an expert understanding of AI. A small percentage of respondents,
6%, consider themselves AI novices.
More CTOs self-assess their level of understanding about AI to be expert
(22% of their group), followed by CIOs (18% of their group) and CISOs (4%
of their group).
When asked about their confidence when making decisions related to AI,
92% of surveyed executives report being confident or very confident.
When broken down by role, nearly half of CTOs (51%) say they are very
confident in their decisions, followed by CIOs at 27% and CISOs at 20%.

## AI adoption and integration
What does AI adoption
look like at their
organizations?
AI ADOPTION AND INTEGRATION
Businesses
welcome AI to
the team
For many, there are two distinct eras of generative AI: before ChatGPT and
after ChatGPT.
Adoption of the tool after its November 2022 release to the public set
records. Overnight, it seemed the entire world — or close to it — was using
generative AI in one way or another. But how closely does that impression
match with reality? We asked executives to walk us through AI adoption in
their organizations.
Almost all organizations have had some level of adoption of AI in the past 12
months: 64% of executives say their organizations have seen moderate
to widespread adoption of AI, followed by 34% of executives who say AI
adoption is limited. Only 2% of executives describe AI adoption
as nonexistent.
This level of adoption is happening despite signals of possible friction.
Executives rate the ease of integrating AI technology at their organizations
as 6.4 on a scale of 0 (not difficult) to 10 (extremely difficult), suggesting the
effort is a moderately difficult undertaking.
Levels of adoption
Widespread: Nearly all teams use at least some AI.
Moderate: Many teams use AI.
Limited: A few teams use AI.
Nonexistent: No teams use AI.
Executives in EMEA report slightly more widespread (19%) and
moderate (50%) levels of AI adoption when compared with APAC and
AMER.
Most executives who see their organizations having moderate to
widespread adoption of AI are from the technology industry, followed
by finance and banking and professional services.
A strong majority of executive teams, consistently across regions, are
either somewhat or very aligned on AI adoption and integration. The level
of alignment among leaders could impact how widespread AI adoption is
within an organization.
Out of the respondents who report widespread AI adoption, 81%
characterize their executive teams as very aligned on AI. While this data
doesn’t establish causation, it suggests a shared vision — clearly and
effectively communicated from the leadership team to employees — could
be a boon to organizations as they seek to bring more AI capabilities into
the fold successfully.
An integral component of AI adoption is creating guidance for employees
that establishes and communicates the appropriate use of AI tools.
Fifty-eight percent of executives — led by those in EMEA at 67% — report
having developed guidance for employees on AI usage. Another 32% say
they plan to do so in the next 12 months. The remaining 10% say they have
not developed any guidance.
Employee guidance is another area where a unified executive team could
make an impact. Respondents with aligned executive teams are more likely
to say their companies have created AI-usage guidance for employees.
Even the degree of alignment could have an influence: 77% of respondents
who report having a very aligned executive team say their organizations
have developed guidance, compared with 54% of respondents who
characterize their executive team as somewhat aligned.
When asked how informed their respective organization’s workforce is
about AI-driven threats, more than two-thirds of survey respondents
(67%) suggest their workforces are either very informed or somewhat
informed about AI-driven threats, with the highest levels seen in EMEA
organizations.
Executive takeaways: What it takes to successfully
adopt and integrate AI
Respondents shared their views on what elements are critical to an
organization successfully adopting and integrating AI.
> “A focus on risk identification, mitigation, and management is needed to
ensure that AI adoption works within the boundaries of acceptable
risk. Secondly, a realistic set of expectations and appropriate metrics for
measuring progress and performance are needed.” (CIO, Healthcare &
Pharmaceuticals, APAC)
> “Proceeding with caution and level-setting expectations early on. New
tech can be dangerous if not adopted appropriately, and company
secrets, drift, and hallucinations need to be high on the list of concerns.”
(CSO/CISO, Technology, AMER)
> “Having a deep understanding of the SWOT matrix for the AI
applications in the target segment is key. You need to know what you
are getting into and weigh the risk-versus-reward ratio.” (CTO, Energy,
Mining, Oil & Gas, APAC)
AI adoption, a closer look
As the AI landscape evolves, so does organizations’ use of the technology,
from bolstering security measures to enhancing customer experiences. We
asked executives about the extent to which AI is being used (if at all) for
security purposes, in customer-facing products, and by internal teams.
Across the business
AI is being used to some degree for security purposes at 71% of surveyed
executives’ companies, with more than half (59%) of executives
characterizing the use as moderate, with specific projects or initiatives.
AI is also making its way into customer-facing products, services, and
features: 85% of respondents say they use AI in consumer-facing offerings.
Of that group, 72% of executives report moderate (58%) or
extensive (14%) integration.
At the workforce level
When asked how their teams are currently using AI, executives report the
most common use case is automation and process optimization (72%),
followed by predictive analytics and forecasting (62%).
In EMEA and APAC, the top AI use case is automation and process
optimization. In AMER, it’s natural language processing (NLP) and
understanding.
Overall, CIOs report fewer unique use cases at their organizations than
CTOs and CISOs, notably focusing their efforts on coding and software
development, personalized recommendations, and computer vision and
analysis.

## AI and the competition
How do executives’
companies stack up
against the
competition?
AI AND THE COMPETITION
Peer perspective:
Comparing
AI adoption
strengths and
weakness
“Know the competition” is a basic business tenet.
After digging into their companies’ approaches to AI, executives shifted
their focus to comparing their strategies with those of industry
competitors.
More than half of survey respondents (55%) believe they’re ahead of
competitors in their ability to adopt AI technology. That sentiment is
strongest among those in APAC (62%) and executives who are CTOs (55%)
and CISOs (64%).
And what about the 11% of respondents who characterize their companies
as below average or not at all competitive? That group provided insight
into why they think their organizations are behind competitors in adopting
and leveraging AI. Their most commonly cited reasons were lack of AI
skills and insufficient data infrastructure.
Executive takeaways: Mind the competitive gap
Respondents reflect on why their companies could be falling behind
in adopting AI.
> “Education [industry] is slow to adopt and change. We usually need
to see others doing it first.” (CSO / CISO, Education, AMER)
> “We're mostly on-prem and running legacy systems. Integration is a
problem.” (CSO / CISO, Media & Communications, EMEA)
> “We are a large organization in healthcare with a very visible parent
company. Our ability to move fast and innovate is heavily limited by
reputation, cost, and impact. We cannot move as fast or adapt as
quickly as our competitors.” (CTO, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,
APAC)

## AI concerns
What are
executives’ AI
concerns?
AI CONCERNS
Assessing executive
worries and company
readiness
“AI will almost certainly increase the volume and heighten the impact of
cyber attacks over the next two years,” according to a report published by
the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre in January 2024.
As the world braces for a surge in AI-assisted attacks, business leaders
must anticipate and then avoid risks. We wanted to know more about their
primary security-related AI concerns and how prepared they are to guard
against attacks.
Executives selected data privacy (74%) as their top prompted concern,
followed closely by security risks (71%).
These concerns are generally consistent across roles, with a few
exceptions: CISOs are more concerned about regulatory compliance,
and CIOs are more concerned about the workforce’s understanding of
AI. Although respondents united around two primary worries, they report
mixed levels of concern about AI’s impact on security at their organizations:
34% say they’re slightly concerned, 28% suggest they’re moderately
concerned, and 11% report they’re extremely concerned. Only 3% report
being not at all concerned, meaning that for the majority of executives,
concern is a constant, regardless of how acutely it’s felt.
So, how ready are companies to defend against AI-fueled security threats
when they come knocking?
More than half (54%) of the surveyed executives say their organizations
are somewhat prepared to defend against AI-driven attacks. Seventeen
percent of respondents characterize their organizations as
either somewhat unprepared or very unprepared.
EMEA has a slight lead in perceived preparedness, with 67% of
respondents from that region saying their companies are very prepared
or somewhat prepared to defend against AI-driven threats. For
perspective, 50% of APAC executives and 58% of AMER respondents
describe their companies as very prepared or somewhat prepared.
Executive takeaways: What worries them about AI
Executives shared what concerns them the most regarding AI’s
impact on security. Although the list was expansive, one specific
worry took the lead: Generative AI tools are helping make phishing
attacks more effective. Here are some more of their reflections:
> “People are always your biggest threat in security. AI is becoming
more and more lifelike as time progresses, and hackers are
becoming faster, adaptable, and innovative. Without educating our
internal team sufficiently on the threats of AI, I believe we are
opening ourselves up to greater risk of a human-enabled security
threat.” (CTO, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals, APAC)
> “Rogue actors using AI to gain access to protected data.” (CIO,
Finance & Banking, AMER)
> “As always, it’s the unknown: How are threat actors deviously
planning to leverage AI against us? It is a very powerful tool for good
as well as for bad.” (CSO / CISO, Technology, AMER)

## AI priorities
What are executives’
AI-related priorities
over the next year?
AI PRIORITIES
Safeguarding
their business’
future
AI outlook, concerns — and now priorities. Executives offered insight into
what they are focusing on in the near term. With rapid developments in
both the technology and its application, respondents focused on the
12-month window following their taking the survey.
Executives forecast AI will impact all the prompted core strategic priorities
— innovation, security, speed to market, and operational efficiency —
with relatively similar magnitude, indicating the continued pervasiveness of
the technology across the business world.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months, respondents selected improving
security and threat detection as a top priority for AI, followed closely
by optimizing organizational efficiencies.
Improving security and threat detection is the top-prompted AI priority in
APAC and the Americas. Optimizing organizational efficiency is the top-
prompted AI priority in EMEA.
CISOs’ priorities largely involve improving security and threat detection,
whereas CIOs are most focused on optimizing organizational efficiencies.
Meanwhile, CTOs show a preference for enhancing innovation and
product development.
When we asked executives to identify their top priority for AI in the next 12
months among prompted alternatives, improving security and threat
detection was the most common, selected by 30%, followed
by optimizing organizational efficiencies (26%) and enhancing
innovation and product development (21%).
Resource-wise, executives appear to feel supported in these efforts: 59%
of respondents are either satisfied or very satisfied with their
organization’s current level of investment in their top priority.

## IAM and AI
The Identity
connection
IAM AND AI
The importance
of Identity in the
AI era
As AI adoption increases globally, Identity is key to helping businesses
embrace the technology’s undeniable power without sacrificing security.
We asked executives to rate how important Identity and Access
Management (IAM) — ensuring the right people have access to the right
resources at the right times — is to adopting and integrating AI at
organizations.
More than three-quarters (79%) of executives suggest IAM is important or
very important when adopting and integrating AI. The very important
cohort is led by those in APAC and in a CIO role.
When responding to an open-ended question regarding the importance of
IAM in AI adoption, the most common response related to ensuring only
authorized users are accessing permitted tools.
Executive takeaways: IAM in focus
Here’s what respondents had to say about the role IAM plays in AI
adoption.
> “IAM is a key pillar in security. It should be at the root of all you do.
Managing who has access to the proper data and systems is
critical.” (CSO / CISO, Education, Americas)
> [IAM] is the only technical control we have to manage who has
access to this new technology. We are slowly opening the gates for
specific justified needs — not being afraid of AI but by embracing it
slowly and methodically. (CSO / CISO, Technology, Americas
> “We need to implement ethical AI, and this comes with the right
level of segregation of duties and authorizations.” (CSO / CISO,
Technology, EMEA)

## Conclusion and methodology
Conclusion and
methodology
Spanning regions, industries, and headcounts, our survey offers a view into
how executives are approaching AI and all its dynamic considerations. And
while the degree to which businesses have adopted AI varies, one thing is
clear: Inaction is not an option.
Conclusion
Leaders must make critical decisions about when, how, and to what
degree to use AI — even as the technology itself is rapidly changing.
Determining what’s next can be difficult, especially considering AI’s many
unknowns. Based on respondents’ answers, here are some paths
organizations — regardless of their level of AI maturity — can consider:
Enhance security
Move swiftly and intentionally to strengthen security infrastructure to
mitigate AI-related threats and risks.
Foster collaboration
Work with industry peers, regulatory bodies, and internal and external
experts to develop and share insights and best practices for responsible AI
collaboration.
Expand education
Prioritize educating employees on those best practices while offering them
the space for learning and experimentation with generative AI tools.
Methodology
Commissioned by Okta, AlphaSights recruited 125 C-suite executives to
take an online double-blinded survey on their sentiments, concerns, and
business priorities regarding AI. In total, 51 CSOs/CISOs, 41 CTOs, and 33
CIOs were surveyed. These experts were engaged via an initial phone
conversation with AlphaSights associates to determine whether or not
they had relevant experience; those with applicable experience received
the survey. AlphaSights fielded the survey in January 2024, recruited the
panel, and put together an initial analysis of the key findings. An Okta team
of marketers and data analysts delved into the results to produce the full
report.
