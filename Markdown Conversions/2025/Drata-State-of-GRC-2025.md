## Executive Summary
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) has long been a critical business function, but in 2025 it is drawing more attention than ever before. Violations and fines regularly make headline news and increased cybersecurity threats demand more resources and attention than in previous years. Organizations have responded by bringing GRC front and center as a measurable enabler to business success. According to a Wakefield Research survey for Drata of 300 U.S. IT and security professionals at companies with 250 to 1,500 employees, nearly all companies (96%) believe that GRC is rising in the spotlight.

Consequently, GRC’s role, responsibilities, and position within companies is evolving. Businesses are pushing GRC teams to the next level — beyond managing risk and maintaining compliance but also expecting GRC teams to demonstrate greater ROI for the business with optimized GRC programs and strategic investments in new compliance frameworks. When that strategy is successful, 98% of professionals surveyed believe GRC achievements are worth touting to customers and other critical stakeholders to build internal and external trust and help demonstrate GRC’s impact on strategic business growth.

But getting there is not simple or easy. Executing a comprehensive GRC program remains a taxing journey, demanding tremendous effort from critical (and already overburdened) professionals across a range of departments and teams — from IT and Legal to Operations, Finance, and Engineering. Despite increased budgets and elevated awareness, GRC remains exhausting, highly manual, and complicated work.

GRC leaders have reasons to be optimistic:
- AI, automation, and intelligent development tools are making operating GRC functions easier
- Security and trust assurance technology is enabling proactive, transparent communication with stakeholders, accelerating deal cycles
- Integrated systems and analytics dashboards are tying GRC efforts to business metrics (i.e. revenue won)

Plus, approaches such as ‘Shift Left’ will ease the load for many, allowing GRC teams to focus on less day-to-day task management and more strategy and planning.

Of companies surveyed, 99% have implemented Shift Left, are in the process, or plan to in the next 12 months.

The ‘Shift Left’ Approach

Trust Management Platforms are helping GRC teams adopt the “Shift Left” approach, integrating compliance processes sooner in development. Shift Left can reduce costs and eliminate security and compliance issues before projects get into production, which also helps speed up time to market.

## GRC Crunch: Caught between compliance complexity and business growth

As the complexity of the security and compliance landscape grows, GRC teams are strapped for additional resources and time.

What’s more, GRC teams face mounting pressure as companies now expect more robust, mature internal GRC programs to unlock revenue, sell faster, build customer trust, expand globally and into new market verticals, and drive new business.

But their plate is already overflowing. Those who perform GRC functions are managing an average of eight compliance frameworks with 60% managing at least five. In the next 12 months, companies expect to add even more, six additional compliance frameworks on average, to already stretched GRC teams.

```
48%
```
struggle to keep pace with updates to existing compliance frameworks and identifying areas needing attention

```
52%
```
are exhausted identifying new frameworks requiring compliance, and integrating those into existing programs

Out of all companies surveyed, 93% would like to see more critical aspects of GRC functions become automated that are manual today.

The reason: Manual interventions account for 14 hours per week on average, with the Retail sector spending more than 19 hours per week on average in cumbersome manual work. Automation could alleviate that burden, freeing time for more strategic priorities.

Existing automation technologies promise to alleviate much of that work and significant overlap in requirements across frameworks make adoption more likely, but implementation still lags. While GRC functions tend to be more automated (40%) than manual (28%), for the majority (83%) it’s a mix of both. Fintech and SaaS companies lead the charge in automated GRC (43%) compared to other industries (40%), but the vast majority of tasks have manual elements.

7%  All manual
20% Mostly manual
32% Equally manual & automated
31% Mostly automated
9%   All automated
```

Question: Are GRC functions at your organization more manual or more automated?

## AI’s Impact on GRC — the Good, the Bad, the Automated

The rise in AI-specific regulations like NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001 add yet another layer of complexity for GRC teams to manage. 100% of companies surveyed expect employees to increase their use of AI technologies in the next 12 months, yet only 10% have a GRC program fully prepared to manage it.

```
44%
```
of companies also anticipate a massive or complete overhaul of the GRC function itself as a result of AI. 73% expect to see the shift in the next six months or sooner.

![Two pie charts showing AI preparedness and impact]

```

```

Question: How prepared is your GRC function to manage increased use of AI among employees?

Question: How much of an impact do you believe AI is having or will have on your organization’s approach to GRC?

GRC teams can see the benefits of leveraging AI

```
44% believe AI will increase data security
46% believe AI will improve regulatory compliance
40% think AI will reduce errors in compliance tasks
42% anticipate enhanced risk management plus streamlined security reviews and questionnaires
37% anticipate a streamlined audit process
40% predict enhanced decision-making and predictive insights
```

AI impact expectations for GRC teams also varies by company size. Smaller companies (less than 1,000 employees) are the most optimistic about AI’s impact on regulatory compliance optimizations (51%) compared to larger businesses (39%). They also feel more likely to benefit from enhanced decision making with AI’s predictive insights (44% versus 34%).

On the flip side, slightly larger companies (1,000 - 1,500 employees) anticipate more improvements to streamlined security and questionnaire reviews (48%) than smaller businesses expect (38%) as well as reduction in human errors (46% for larger companies, 36% for smaller organizations).

Leadership is the most optimistic for these positive effects: C-level and senior executives are more hopeful for AI impact (42%) in comparison to mid-level employees (30%).

Early AI adopters are already seeing the impact on GRC and Security team efficiency.

Yet, concerns linger as GRC teams are still expected to maintain standards of governance and control while risk exposure grows from AI usage. Many shared fears center around AI biases impacting GRC decision making (43%) and AI hallucinations giving improper GRC guidance (39%).

GRC teams must balance AI’s transformative potential with the capabilities, impact, and security of various technologies as they navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.

## GRC Programs Maturing into Growth Centers and Trust Builders

Companies with strong, mature GRC practices in place enter new markets more quickly and effectively, adapt to changing regulatory landscapes, and close revenue faster.

Yet, survey results demonstrate that most GRC programs are not where they need to be in terms of maturity. 41% of companies see themselves at an adolescent stage, monitoring and scaling, or shy of full maturity (37%). While optimization programs have begun for many, few have been fully realized.

![Bar graph showing GRC program maturity levels]

```
41% of companies surveyed see their current program as still in a developmental stage - monitoring and scaling
37% of companies surveyed see their current program closing in on full maturity
```

As part of this evolution, companies are looking to expand GRC’s position from regulatory requirement and cost center to strategic business and trust enabler as well.

![Bar graph showing primary focus of GRC programs]

```
38% Business growth
33% Security & reputation protection
13% Complying with regulations
9%  Audits & meeting industry standards
7%  Avoiding fines & legal issues
```

Question: What is the primary focus of your organization’s Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) program?

Trends are emerging as companies identify ways to reprioritize GRC’s position and priorities to drive maturity.

1. Adding a dedicated GRC leader to oversee strategy and drive outcomes
2. Making revenue growth a key priority for GRC investments and programs
3. Building strong GRC programs to safeguard the company’s brand and demonstrate commitment to security
4. Transparently sharing GRC impact to build trust internally and externally
5. Moving from a reactive to proactive stance in protection, communication, and showcasing ROI

```
91% of companies who now have a dedicated person in charge of GRC
38% of companies say the primary focus of GRC programs is business growth
33% of companies say the primary focus of their GRC program is reputation protection and security
98% of companies see GRC as a business driver
74% of companies describe their GRC program as proactive vs 26% who see their role as reactive
```

The majority of survey respondents see GRC as a business driver (98%), and have a dedicated person in charge of GRC (91%). GRC leaders, CISOs, CCOs, and COOs investing in these strategies are improving operational efficiency, enhancing decision-making, and strengthening brand reputation as a result. Cumbersome, manual processes are being replaced with AI automation, cross functional workflows are streamlined with workplace productivity tool integrations, and continuous controls monitoring is enhancing risk management and resource allocation.

Many companies see business growth as the primary focus for GRC (38%). Sales and customer success teams proactively and transparently share a company’s security posture with both prospects early in deal cycles and customers during renewals to build and maintain customer trust, streamline security reviews, and accelerate time to close and renew. These are provided in a self-service, customer-centric fashion, allowing these reviews to be conducted on the customer’s timeline.

Data from these reviews also supports strategic decisions made by GRC teams, such as, “Which reports, artifacts, and policies are requested the most by customers?” because reputation protection and security are a focus for organizations as well (33%). This allows GRC teams to truly be proactive (74%) vs reactive (26%) by using a data-driven position to inform decisions around maintaining and growing their GRC posture.

Lastly, when coupled with data from opportunities, data from these interactions also helps solve the ROI equation many GRC teams want to answer: “How much revenue did our GRC efforts unlock?” Answering that question helps quantifiably showcase the benefits while operational GRC functions contribute to overall business objectives.

## Growth of Trust and Automation on the Horizon

GRC — as a defined discipline — emerged only two decades ago. While individual components of governance, risk management, and compliance have existed for much longer, their integration into the GRC framework we recognize today was partly driven by corporate scandals in the early 2000s and subsequent introduction of stricter regulations.

Since then, complexity for GRC teams has only grown.

But professionals are optimistic that technology innovations and enhanced business focus on GRC will lead to positive outcomes.

```

Question: Which of the following trends will positively impact GRC?

GRC teams stand at the cusp of a transformative era. In the next five years, their role in building customer trust will be paramount.

Leading GRC teams will evolve from risk mitigators to strategic business enablers, leveraging advanced technologies to drive innovation and efficiency while championing transparency in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

In this new frontier, GRC will not just safeguard the business—it will actively propel it forward, turning compliance into a competitive advantage and trust into a tangible asset. The GRC function of tomorrow will be a cornerstone of organizational resilience. It will drive business growth, and ensure customer confidence in an ever-changing global market.

Methodological Notes

The Drata Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research among 300 U.S. IT & Security Professionals ranging from GRC-related and IT Security titles that work for companies with 250 – 1,500 employees from High-Tech, SaaS, FinTech, HealthTech and Retail industries , between November 21st and December 11th, 2024, using an email invitation and an online survey.

Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 5.7 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. Small base size, findings are directional.
