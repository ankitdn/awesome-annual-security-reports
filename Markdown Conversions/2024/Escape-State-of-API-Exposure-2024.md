### Key Takeaways
Tristan Kalos, CEO of Escape
The State of API Exposure 2024 report provides an in-depth analysis of the
 significant risks associated with exposed APIs, highlighting vulnerabilities across large organizations, including Fortune 1000 companies and CAC 40 entities. Key findings reveal the pervasive nature of API security issues and the need for improved security measures:

1,834 Highly Critical Vulnerabilities in Fortune 1000 Companies: Among the identified vulnerabilities, 1834 were classified as highly critical, directly affecting Fortune 1000 companies. These critical vulnerabilities, often associated with broken authentication and configuration errors, place essential systems and sensitive data at significant risk of exposure and exploitation. Critical issues span various sectors, impacting tech platforms, financial companies, insurance, healthcare, tech, and others.

Development APIs: Nearly 4,000 development APIs were publicly accessible, often lacking adequate security controls. Exposing these APIs can inadvertently reveal sensitive information and offer attackers potential entry points.

Exposed Secrets: The report found 1,816 highly sensitive secrets exposed within API environments, including access tokens, API keys, and authentication credentials. These exposed secrets significantly heighten the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of critical systems.

Call to action: We recommend to start auditing all APIs—particularly shadow and legacy APIs—to identify and secure vulnerabilities, and restricting access to development APIs with production-level security standards. Implementing continuous monitoring and scanning tools is crucial to detect risks early, while ensuring that all secrets are encrypted and securely managed to prevent exposure.

### Conclusion
THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNSECURED
APIS EXPOSED IN THE WILD
API sprawl has emerged as a significant
challenge in recent years. As organizations
increasingly rely on APIs to fuel digital
transformation, connect services, and
deliver data-driven experiences, the sheer
number of APIs in production has
skyrocketed.
As we move through 2024, the exponential
growth of APIs presents new challenges.
According to recent Gartner’s market
guide, APIs - especially shadow and
dormant ones - are causing data breaches
among organizations that, on average,
exceed the magnitude of other breaches.
Since 2022, at least 190M sensitive data
records have been breached. In our
previous research, we estimate that
enterprise companies lost $31B due to
breaches.
Many APIs are pushed to production too
soon, often bypassing critical security
testing stages or, in some cases, being
tested only after deployment rather than
within development environments.
This rush to release frequently leads to gaps
in security coverage, allowing untested or
under-tested endpoints to expose sensitive
information or become vulnerable to attack.
Another significant factor is the proliferation
of "shadow APIs"—APIs that exist outside
the knowledge or management of security
teams. These undocumented, unmanaged,
or abandoned APIs often lack essential
security protocols, making them especially
prone to exploitation. Shadow APIs can
emerge from development shortcuts, legacy
applications, or third-party integrations that
slip through regular security oversight,
creating hidden risks within the system’s
architecture.
Given these trends, API security deserves
greater attention. It is now widely recognized
as a critical challenge requiring stringent
security management and thorough testing
before APIs are released into production
environments. By analyzing Fortune 1000
and CAC 40 exposed API services we’re here
to prove it.

unique top-level domains analyzed
In-Depth API Discovery Process
Escape uses a sophisticated combination of techniques to identify and inventory APIs by
scanning exposed source code:
Subdomain enumeration
Escape begins by performing subdomain enumeration. This process involves scanning for all
subdomains associated with the main domain you previously entered into the platform.
Subdomains often host APIs or services that may not be immediately apparent. By identifying
these subdomains, Escape can uncover additional endpoints that might otherwise be missed.
This initial step lays the foundation for a comprehensive discovery process.
AI-powered fingerprinting
Once subdomains are identified, Escape employs AI-powered fingerprinting to recognize and
classify the APIs. Fingerprinting involves analyzing various characteristics of the APIs, such
as their structure, endpoints, and response patterns. The AI algorithms used by Escape can
detect and categorize different API types (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) with high accuracy. This
machine learning-based approach ensures that APIs are identified and classified correctly,
even if they have unique or non-standard configurations.
OSINT techniques
Escape also leverages Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques. OSINT involves
gathering and analyzing publicly available information to enhance the discovery process. By
examining code repositories, documentation, and other public resources, Escape can identify
additional API endpoints and services. This technique helps in discovering APIs that are not
directly exposed but can still be found through public information.
Through this multi-layered process, we discovered 158,079 subdomains, allowing for
extensive coverage and a highly detailed analysis. This broad scope provided a deep view
into the exposure and security practices around APIs across various industries, offering
critical insights into the current landscape of API security and vulnerability.

MethodologyAPI specifications found in the wild
Automated API Specification Generation
API specifications programmatically generated
Having an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is particularly beneficial as it provides a
standardized, machine-readable format for documenting RESTful APIs, promoting clarity and
consistency across services.

Through our initial scan, we located 4,547 exposed API specifications, so we had to generate
most of the specifications ourselves. This process involved parsing the Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST) from the code to create dynamically detailed and accurate API specifications.
Luckily, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently become extremely good at analyzing
and generating code. Moreover, they show great performance across a wide variety of code
languages, frameworks, and coding styles, which is exactly what we want for framework and
language-agnostic OAS generation software. Finally, LLMs can also leverage information in
code comments, which the traditional static analysis approach cannot do.
In our current approach, integrated into Escape’s platform, we focused on two key areas:
Semantic Analysis: We identify essential code fragments using custom rules (e.g.,
Semantic Analysis: We identify essential code fragments using custom rules (e.g., specific Semgrep patterns), optimizing the data sent to the LLM and enhancing prompt quality.
Specification Generation: The LLM processes each identified fragment to generate precise OAS methods, with contextualization ensuring accuracy by resolving dependencies and references within the code.

MethodologyAPI services scanned for vulnerabilities
Final step - API Security Scanning
After the comprehensive specification generation process, the final step is API security
scanning. Using Escape’s Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) solution, we conducted
in-depth analysis of each identified API endpoint to detect potential vulnerabilities and risks.
Escape’s DAST approach is specifically designed for API security. Unlike traditional web
application DAST tools, which are often limited in scope and primarily test web applications at
the surface level, Escape’s DAST is purpose-built to handle the unique requirements and
complexities of APIs. This makes it exceptionally effective at identifying security flaws in API
configurations, authentication, authorization, and more.
At the core of Escape's DAST is a proprietary algorithm that combines static and dynamic
analysis to deliver precise, high-confidence results. The algorithm operates in multiple stages:
1. Contextual Analysis: The algorithm first conducts a contextual analysis of each endpoint,
 identifying the API’s structure, parameters, and dependencies. This allows it to adapt its scanning approach to each specific API, ensuring relevance and reducing false positives.
2. Fuzzing and Payload Injection: In the next stage, the algorithm uses fuzzing techniques to test each endpoint by sending random, unexpected, or malformed inputs. This helps identify weaknesses like input validation flaws, injection vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. The algorithm adapts these payloads based on real-time feedback, simulating complex attacks more effectively than conventional static methods.
3. Behavioral Monitoring: As it interacts with each endpoint, the algorithm monitors response patterns and behaviors to detect anomalies. By observing responses over multiple interactions, it can identify issues such as data exposure, error leakage, and misconfigured permissions, providing insights into the API’s security posture.
4. Risk Prioritization: Escape’s DAST concludes with an analysis that ranks detected vulnerabilities based on risk and classifies them based on the metric named Escape severity.Escape severity.

report. Instead, we focused on secrets accessible through vulnerable
APIs identified by our DAST scans.
High impact secrets found

highly critical vulnerabilities
Among the exposed APIs, we identified at least 198 critical vulnerabilities, including various
CVEs and OWASP Top 10 risks, such as API2:2023: Broken Authentication and API8:2023:
Security Misconfiguration. These vulnerabilities include risks that could allow unauthorized
access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential unauthorized control over critical
applications. The nature and distribution of these vulnerabilities indicate a systemic gap in
security practices across development environments, as many of these APIs lack proper
access control, authentication, and monitoring.
More than that, our analysis highlighted that six organizations were particularly impacted, each
with over 100 exposed development APIs within their domains. Of these:
*   Five organizations are listed within the Fortune 1000 companies, representing some of the largest and most influential corporations globally.
*   One organization is part of the CAC40 index, underscoring that even prominent European enterprises are not immune to these security oversights.

Many of these APIs lacked even the most basic access controls, allowing for unauthorized data
access or manipulation. A staggering 19 NoSQL injection vulnerabilities and 11 SQL injection flaws
were scattered across APIs, with 10 instances of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)—all
creating a perfect storm for potential exploitation.
It is clear that API security practices hadn’t kept up with the growing reliance on APIs across
industries, revealing a systemic gap in both development and deployment practices. To tackle this,
companies need to close the gap with immediate action: strengthen access controls, enforce secure
configurations, and regularly test APIs to catch issues before they become threats.
By design, Actuator exposes diagnostic and monitoring data, such as environment variables, configuration properties, and detailed mappings of application routes. However, if not properly secured, these endpoints can inadvertently expose sensitive information about an application’s internal state, providing attackers with critical insights that can be leveraged to exploit vulnerabilities.
During a security assessment of one of the exposed API endpoints owned by a major American technology company, we gained unrestricted access to several Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, specifically:
*   `https://[redactedcompanydomain.com]/admin/actuator/env`
*   `https://[redactedcompanydomain.com]/admin/actuator/mappings`
*   `https://[redactedcompanydomain.com]/admin/actuator/httptrace`

Each of these endpoints revealed sensitive details about the application’s environment, structure, and operations, collectively presenting a substantial security risk.
The first significant finding was with the `/env` endpoint, which revealed critical environment variables in plain text. Upon loading the endpoint’s response, it became clear that sensitive information—such as database credentials, API keys, and service tokens—was accessible without any obfuscation. Exposure of these variables presents a substantial risk, as they can provide unauthorized actors with the means to gain elevated access, move laterally through systems, and potentially launch further targeted attacks on backend services.
Further investigation led to the `/mappings` endpoint, which disclosed a comprehensive map of the API’s routing structure. This included not only public endpoints but also private routes intended for restricted internal use. By detailing the API’s route mappings and configuration, the endpoint unintentionally provided a roadmap of the system’s structure, revealing potential entry points and avenues for exploitation. In the hands of an attacker, this visibility into the application’s internal architecture could simplify the task of identifying weak spots and exploiting vulnerabilities in a targeted manner.
The third exposed endpoint, `/httptrace`, offered a detailed log of recent HTTP requests, complete with request headers, response statuses, and metadata. This level of trace data, including potential session cookies and internal IP addresses, can significantly aid an attacker in reconstructing user behavior, mimicking legitimate requests, or even hijacking active sessions. Such logs can facilitate a range of attacks, from session replay to broader reconnaissance efforts, making the exposure of this endpoint particularly sensitive.

### American multinational tech company: Exposed Spring Boot Actuator
1.  Restrict Access to Actuator Endpoints:
Implement access control to ensure that sensitive Actuator endpoints, such as `/env`, `/mappings`, and `/httptrace`, are accessible only to authorized users on the internal network or authenticated users with administrative privileges.
2.  Disable Sensitive Actuator Endpoints in Production:
Configure the Spring Boot Actuator settings to disable endpoints like `/env`, `/mappings`, and `/httptrace` in the production environment, or at least restrict them to authorized, internal users only.
3.  Obfuscate Sensitive Data in `/env`:
In cases where `/env` must be used, consider redacting or obfuscating sensitive environment variables, such as database credentials and API keys, to prevent accidental exposure.
4.  Monitor and Log Access Attempts to Actuator Endpoints:
Implement logging and monitoring of all access attempts to these endpoints, enabling detection of any unauthorized access and facilitating incident response.

Overall, this assessment underscores how easily operational details can become visible without proper restrictions, turning what might otherwise be routine endpoints into critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these exposures is essential to uphold the security and integrity of the company’s infrastructure.

### Essential remediation steps
This extensive exposure of vulnerable APIs underscores a critical security issue.
If you have publicly accessible APIs or are uncertain about whether your developers
 adhere to best practices to prevent unsecured staging or development APIs from being
g exposed, we recommend taking the following actions immediately:
1.  Conduct a Comprehensive API Audit: Review all public-facing APIs to identify any endpoints that are exposed unintentionally. This includes testing for staging, development, and unused APIs that may have been left accessible. Categorize APIs based on sensitivity, usage, and the type of data they handle. This helps prioritize which APIs require immediate attention and remediation.
2.  Deactivate Unused or Duplicate APIs: Regularly review and disable APIs that are no longer in use or required. This practice helps reduce the attack surface of your application and minimizes potential security risks associated with outdated or redundant APIs.
3.  Recheck for Exposed API Secrets: Conduct a thorough check to ensure that API keys, tokens, and other secrets are not exposed in public repositories, documentation, or within API endpoints. Implement automated secret scanning tools to prevent such exposures continuously.
4.  Implement an API Governance Strategy: Establish a robust API governance strategy to manage the growing number of APIs across your organization. This strategy should include standardized processes for API development, documentation, versioning, and security, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of unsecured APIs.
5.  Enforce Authentication and Authorization: Ensure all APIs are protected with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Use industry-standard methods like OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and role-based access controls to restrict access and prevent unauthorized use.
6.  Implement Automated API Discovery: Deploy automated API discovery tools to continuously scan and catalog all APIs, including shadow, unused, and potentially exposed APIs. This proactive approach ensures full visibility of your API environment.
7.  Implement an Automated Security Solution that Can Start Scanning in Minutes:
 Utilize a security solution that enables immediate scanning of your API ecosystem for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. A solution that provides quick setup and fast scanning capabilities can help identify and mitigate risks efficiently without disrupting workflows.
8.  Educate Your Internal Teams: Ensure that all team members understand the importance of token security and adhere to best practices. Consider enhancing the security experience through gamification or implementing a Security Champion Program, following [The Security Champion Program Success Guide](link-to-guide).

These measures are crucial for
protecting your APIs and maintaining secure and compliant applications. For more detailed information, you can use our [API Security Checklist](link-to-checklist) or refer to the resources provided on the [Escape blog](link-to-blog).

Securing all your APIs is hard. It’s even harder when you don’t know what you have to secure, want to ship (insecure) APIs too fast in the wild and have to monitor them at large scale. Your organization is now not only prone to data breach risks but also to severe financial implications.Our study reveals that over 100,000 vulnerabilities are present across Fortune 1000 and CAC 40 companies, with 1,800 classified as highly critical, directly impacting some of the largest organizations globally.
One of the most striking findings was the extensive exposure of vulnerable development APIs and the high level of overall vulnerability criticality. This highlights the real and present dangers for each organization and the necessity of thoroughly testing applications both before and after deployment.
Moreover, we identified that organizations continue to expose sensitive secrets, including access tokens and API keys, within their API environments, amplifying security risks and potential misuse.
Organizations must respond fast, adopting best practices for risk mitigation and integrating continuous, automated testing of their applications.
