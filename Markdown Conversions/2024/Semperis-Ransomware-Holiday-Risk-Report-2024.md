“Threat actors … are calculated and persistent in
their attack methods. Security awareness and
functionality don’t wax and wane. If anything,
organizations should increase their security
persistence on holidays and weekends, knowing
that threat actors aren’t taking time off.”

Chris Inglis

First US National Cyber Director

Expert guidance for strengthening ransomware defense, especially during
high-risk periods such as holidays, weekends, and corporate transitions

Insights into ransomware attack patterns from a survey of 900 IT
and security leaders, revealing that many organizations lack adequate
defenses against attacks that strike during times of distraction

New evidence that organizations routinely overestimate
their ability to defend against identity-based attacks

## Executive Summary
Ransomware attacks don’t observe business hours, and
attacks often move too quickly for human intervention alone.
Therefore, automated identity playbooks are required to
mitigate risk.

Threat actors strike during periods of absence or distraction,
such as holidays, weekends, and corporate events, including
mergers and acquisitions.

Organizations across the globe are locked in a battle against ransomware
and cyberattacks. As the stakes increase, so does the evidence that
Microsoft Active Directory is a top target for threat actors and that
identity threat detection and response (ITDR) is a key aspect of both
cyber and operational resilience.

To examine trends in ransomware’s frequency, severity, and impact,
Semperis partnered with international research firm Censuswide to
conduct a comprehensive study spanning multiple industries across
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The
first report of our findings—2024 Ransomware Risk Report—revealed
that ransomware attacks are incessant and costly. Now, our second
report—2024 Ransomware Holiday Risk Report—examines the timing of
attacks that occur during periods of corporate distraction (including
holidays, weekends, and material events such as mergers, IPOs, and
layoffs) and potential gaps in organizations’ cybersecurity defenses.

Ransomware groups frequently strike
outside of business hours.

Ransomware attackers often strike when defenses are weakest—86% of study
participants who experienced a ransomware attack were targeted on
a weekend or holiday, when staffing is most likely to be reduced.

Organizations typically reduce security staffing
during the most likely times of attack.

Even though 96% of surveyed organizations maintained a security operations center (SOC),
85% reduced SOC staffing by as much as 50% on holidays and weekends.

Material corporate events present attractive
opportunities for ransomware attackers.

From an attacker’s perspective, mergers, acquisitions, IPOs, and workforce
restructuring provide useful distractions as business and technology leaders focus
on event requirements rather than cyber defenses. Mergers and acquisitions are
also notorious for providing opportunities to breach Active Directory, and 63% of
respondents experienced a ransomware attack following a material
corporate event.

Business leaders must prioritize
strengthening identity system defense.

With Active Directory as the core of organizations’ access to systems and resources,
identity-based attacks are a growing threat. Yet 40% of companies do not have—
or are uncertain that they have--sufficient budget to defend core identity
systems such as Active Directory. Without sufficient budget to address identity
system defense, many organizations are missing key parts of an effective ITDR strategy.

## Effective Operational Resilience Is a 24/7/365 Initiative
Study of global IT and security
leaders reveals a striking gap in
ransomware defenses.

“Threat actors want to make as much money
as possible with the least hassle. They look for
events that give them more leverage, and they
try to catch organizations unprepared.”

Sean Deuby
Principal Technologist
(North America), Semperis

Ransomware attackers are adept at hiding their activities.
Whether masquerading as legitimate users to breach
Zero Trust defenses or using an attack like DCShadow to
bypass detection mechanisms, stealth is a key part of the
cyberattack playbook. And, as our new global study reveals,
this tactic extends beyond the method of attack.

Despite widespread cybersecurity efforts, many
organizations are unintentionally opening a door to
ransomware by reducing their defenses during
weekends and holidays. Attackers clearly expect this
behavior and target these periods—as well as other
material corporate events that might signal distracted
or reduced defenses—to strike.

Organizations that aim to strengthen their cyber defenses
can use this information to their advantage. Implementing
robust, automated protection and recovery solutions for
the identity infrastructure can help to foil ransomware
attempts, even during times of corporate upheaval or
when human resources are scarce.

Cybersecurity experts and the consortium of national
cybersecurity agencies from the US, UK, Australia, New
Zealand, and Canada known as the Five Eyes alliance are
increasingly focused on the value of effective identity
threat detection and response (ITDR). An unprecedented
report released by the alliance in September 2024 is a
warning that identity systems—especially Active Directory
—are often referred to as “the keys to the kingdom”
because of their pivotal role in identity and access
management (IAM). On-premises Active Directory and
related cloud-based identity systems, such as Entra ID and
Okta, form the basis of Zero Trust capabilities and are a
primary target for cyberattackers, who use these systems
to move laterally, escalate privilege, and gain access to
sensitive resources.

As part of Semperis’ mission to be a force for good,
we are dedicated to helping organizations understand
the business implications of ransomware and improve
their ITDR capabilities. Toward these goals, Semperis
recently conducted a detailed study of 900 IT and security
professionals from global organizations across the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

We surveyed global enterprise IT, security, and risk-
management professionals across multiple industries,
including education, finance, healthcare, manufacturing
and utilities, IT and telecommunications, and travel
and transportation. The first Semperis report based on
these study responses, 2024 Ransomware Risk Report,
discussed the prevalence and effects of ransomware.

Our new report expands on this research, providing
expert insights into common ransomware attack timing
and revealing how business and cybersecurity leaders
can improve their organization’s cyber and operational
resilience.

We encourage you to share this information not just
with your IT and security teams but also with business
leadership. Expanding your organization’s ITDR strategy
to provide sufficient defense during high-threat periods
and to enable fast, secure recovery of the hybrid Active
Directory environment is a top business imperative to
reduce downtime risk.

## Key Findings
Ransomware attackers strike when security
coverage is lighter or when companies are distracted.

Ransomware strikes
when it’s least
expected—and
most damaging.

72% of survey respondents (86% of those targeted by ransomware) were
attacked on a holiday or weekend, and 63% of respondents (76% of
targeted organizations) suffered a ransomware attack during a major
corporate event, such as a merger, acquisition, or IPO.

Security staffing
is a widespread
challenge.

85% of organizations that maintain a year-round, 24-hour SOC—whether
outsourced or operated in-house—reduce staffing on holidays and
weekends by up to 50%, due to staffing challenges and difficulty justifying
higher overtime costs when most employees are out of the office.

Organizations seem
to overestimate their
identity defenses.

81% of respondents believe they have the necessary expertise to protect
against identity-related attacks, yet 83% suffered a successful
ransomware attack within the past 12 months.

Many identity
recovery plans show
concerning gaps.

40% of respondents either have no budget or are unsure whether they
have budget dedicated to defending core identity systems such as
Active Directory.

## Attackers Don’t Take Holidays
For cyber criminals, office closures offer huge opportunities.

“When attackers
get inside a
company’s
systems, especially
if it’s on a holiday
weekend when
staff is diminished,
they may not be
noticed right away.
Companies are less
careful and more
vulnerable during
those periods, and
attackers know
that.”

Guido Grillenmeier
Principal Technologist
(EMEA), Semperis

Imagine returning from a relaxing weekend only to discover that Active
Directory is down and your critical IT systems are being held for ransom.
This was the reality for nearly three-quarters (72%) of the 900 companies
included in our study. In fact, 86% of those who experienced a ransomware
attack were targeted on a weekend or holiday.

What makes these periods a threat-actor favorite? Organizations tend
to reduce both general and security operations center (SOC) staffing
during holidays and weekends, which can also be times of distraction for
employees preparing to be away from the office. Cyber criminals see these
lowered defenses as an opening for attack.

Ciaran Martin, CB, Managing Director at Paladin Capital Group and founding
Chief Executive of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, notes: “It is
human nature for services not to be as strong on the weekends, as many
[organizations maintain] the mindset of the workweek. ... And when staffing
levels decrease, naturally the fallout could be systems that are
more vulnerable to breach.”

“Sophisticated criminal organizations exercise patience,” says Chris Inglis,
Semperis Strategic Advisor and first US National Cyber Director. “They’ll
compromise a network and lay low for long periods—scouting, normalizing
their presence, and creating a foothold inside your system, where they
will wait for an advantageous time to extract data and then deploy their
ransomware payload during a holiday, weekend, or material event. Suddenly,
you’re being attacked literally from the inside.”

Yet for many respondents, the timing of the attacks came as a surprise.
“When fewer people are in the office, there’s less demand for that help-
desk role, and internal risks are lower,” says Guido Grillenmeier, Principal
Technologist (EMEA) at Semperis. “So, it’s understandable that companies
with a hybrid SOC—one that fulfills both cybersecurity and help-desk roles—
might ask, ‘Why do I need to have so many people here?’”

## Attackers Strike When SOC Staffing Is Reduced
Ransomware threats demand 24/7/365 attention.

“Cybersecurity cannot wax and wane.
It must be steady and ever-present.”

Chris Inglis
Semperis Strategic Advisor,
former US National Cyber Director

Most of the organizations included in our study
(96%) said their SOC operates 24/7/365,
through some combination of internal and
external resources. Even so, the majority of
global companies (85%) scale back on their
after-hours SOC staffing levels by up to 50%.
And alarmingly, nearly 5% of respondents
indicated that their SOC is not staffed at all
during holidays or weekends.

Organizations that scaled back SOC staffing
during holidays and weekends did so for multiple reasons:
- They did not think it was necessary, considering most employees work only during weekdays or their business was open only Monday through Friday.
- Their business had never been targeted by ransomware, or they did not believe that it would be targeted.
- They were attempting to maintain a work-life balance for staff.

In addition, many countries mandate higher rates of pay for holiday, overnight, or
weekend hours. Fully staffing a SOC during these periods can incur significant costs;
reducing staffing levels to offset those expenses, especially for hybrid SOCs that might
see fewer help-desk requests, can be tempting.

Semperis CEO Mickey Bresman advises against skimping on cybersecurity coverage,
regardless of the reasoning. “24/7/365 coverage is a necessity, as are automated
identity playbooks that serve to reduce risk and improve operational resilience,”
he cautions.

Jeff Wichman, Semperis Director of Incident Response, also notes that even when a
SOC operates around the clock, staff reductions can be risky. “If you’re big enough to
have a SOC, it should be staffed at all times—and not by a skeleton crew,” he warns. “It
should be at least 75 percent staffed, and SOC teams should have effective automated
threat detection and response solution in place as well.”

Organizations in the US were most likely to maintain 24-hour,
year-round SOC coverage but also most likely to reduce staffing
to less than 50% during weekends and holidays.
Organizations in the travel/transportation industry were most
likely to maintain staffing of 50% or more during weekends and holidays.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Despite the high incidence of holiday and weekend cyberattacks, most
organizations reduce SOC staffing over holidays and weekends.
Conversely, German companies were the most likely to maintain staffing
of 50% or more during office closures.

## Attacks Occur During Times of Corporate Distraction
Leadership and staff changes,
system integrations, and
mergers create vulnerabilities.

“I am not at all surprised by the percentage of
organizations that are attacked after a corporate
event. ... During material events, the business
priority is to complete the event—not security.”

Simon Hodgkinson
Strategic Advisor, Semperis
Former bp CISO

Times of corporate upheaval—whether a merger,
acquisition, IPO, or reduction in workforce—are
also magnets for ransomware attackers. Semperis
survey data show that the majority (63%) of
respondents also experienced a ransomware
attack following a material corporate event.

Not only do these situations create the distractions
that bad actors love to exploit, but attackers can
often extract large ransoms from companies
desperate to regain access to critical systems or
prove operational competence ahead of a major
transaction. In addition, such events create inherent
identity security challenges.

“During a merger or acquisition, cybersecurity best
practices, which are difficult to fully achieve under
normal circumstances, become far more difficult,”
notes Sean Deuby, Principal Technologist (North
America) at Semperis.

Merging entities must integrate their identity
infrastructures—typically Active Directory
environments. Ideally, both organizations will
audit each other’s systems to identify potential
vulnerabilities before such integration begins.
“If an adversary can get hold of a company that
has a weak security posture when two companies
merge, they gain a beachhead that can be used
to bounce into the more secure environment,”
says Bresman.

More often, however, cyber due diligence is
sacrificed in favor of financial concerns and
operational expedience. Even when IT teams are
consulted about cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
business leaders might pressure them to move
forward despite identified risks. As Deuby notes,
“The CEO is not going to delay a merger date because
of a security vulnerability. They want to get the
merger done and worry about it afterwards.”

During the chaos of system integration, what’s
considered “normal behavior” is in flux. Because
threat detection often depends on behavioral
analytics, suspicious activity becomes much
more difficult to define and, therefore, detect.
Threat actors thrive on such confusion.

Legacy systems also pose an opportunity for threat
actors. Transition teams are often reluctant to
disturb older, potentially fragile systems.
“Legacy applications remain prime targets for a
long time, increasing the attack surface,” Deuby
says. “And yet, rebuilding them is typically not
cost effective. So, the long tail of an acquisition
can be really dangerous.”

Lastly, the restructuring that often accompanies
corporate events can provoke malicious actions.
As Simon Hodgkinson, Semperis Strategic Advisor
and former bp CISO, points out, “When you have
disgruntled employees or former employees, the
risk of an insider threat goes through the roof.”

In Germany, organizations were significantly less likely to suffer
an attack during these periods.
Corporate events create distractions and pressure to overlook cyber due
diligence. Technical debt, legacy systems, and the potential
for disgruntled employees present additional risks.

## Identity Protection Is Pivotal to Business Resilience
Operational resilience depends on strong Active Directory
security and a dedicated identity system recovery plan.

“Cyberattacks, including
ransomware, often
happen in the cracks—
during mergers,
acquisitions, layoffs,
and in the seams
of supplier-vendor
relationships. … To
combat never-ending
ransomware attacks,
organizations should
focus on building
resilience
into their networks.”

Kemba Walden
Paladin Global
Institute President,
former Acting US
National Cyber Director

Whether for financial or cultural reasons, organizations are facing
a clear gap in their cyber defenses. Fully staffing a 24/7/365 SOC
might help to close this gap, as would increasing IT and security
resources immediately before, during, and after material
corporate events.

Realistically, such an increase in staffing might be difficult to
achieve. Yet organizations must take steps to strengthen their
ransomware defenses during these critical periods.

[Active Directory’s] pivotal role in
authentication and authorisation makes
it a valuable target for malicious actors.
– Five Eyes alliance

For most organizations, strengthening operational
resilience means improving their ability to defend and
recover Active Directory.

In September 2024, the Five Eyes alliance—a cybersecurity
advisory group comprising the Australian Signals Directorate
(ASD), the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the US National Security Agency (NSA), the Canadian
Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), and the UK National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC-UK)—published a report encouraging organizations
to “better protect Active Directory from malicious actors.”[^1]

“Microsoft’s Active Directory is the most widely used authentication
and authorisation solution in enterprise information technology
(IT) networks globally [and its] pivotal role in authentication and

[^1]: Detecting and Mitigating Microsoft Active Directory Compromises, September 2024.

authorisation makes it a valuable target for malicious actors,” according to the Five Eyes’ advisory,
which also notes that Active Directory security is pivotal to “overall network security.”

A truly effective ransomware and cyber-threat defense strategy, then, must include strong identity
protection. Organizations are aware of the importance of ITDR, as 70% of our study respondents
claimed to have an identity recovery plan and 81% believe they have the necessary identity security
expertise to protect against identity-related attacks.

Yet, as illustrated in this report and the 2024 Ransomware Recovery Report, organizations might be
overestimating their ransomware defense capabilities, including Active Directory–specific backup
systems and solutions to enable fast recovery of the identity system.

Wichman emphasizes that the ransomware threat—specifically, the threat to a company’s critical
identity systems—needs to be considered separately from other technology risks, such as outages
or disasters.

“I’ve seen organizations put a war room together during a cyber incident,” he says. “That can work from
an outage perspective, but it’s useless in a ransomware attack. For those situations, that approach to
recovery is simply too little, too late.”

- 20% of responding organizations that have an identity recovery plan DO NOT take cyber-specific use cases into account.
- 17% DO NOT include measures to test for identity vulnerabilities.
- 34% TEST their identity backups and identity recovery plan ONLY QUARTERLY—or less frequently.
- 61% DO NOT include dedicated, Active Directory–specific backup systems, which are crucial to ensuring a fast, malware-free recovery of the identity system.

## Aligning Business Priorities
Elevating cybersecurity to a business priority and implementing
automated monitoring solutions will help organizations protect
themselves against ransomware risk.

“It is critical to thwart identity-based attacks as that takes care of an important part of the problem. As time
goes by, due to new regulations, organizations are going to have to be able to recover more quickly from
ransomware. And recovering an identity system will be increasingly important.”

Ciaran Martin
CB, Paladin Capital Group Managing Director and founding Chief Executive
of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre

Ransomware attacks can, and do, strike when
least expected. No company—regardless of
region, sector, or SOC status—should
underestimate the need for constant vigilance.

Furthermore, cybersecurity leaders are
increasingly insistent that successful ransomware
defense efforts must include a clear plan to
defend and recover Active Directory.

So, what steps can business, technology,
and security leaders take to reduce the
likelihood of a successful ransomware attack and
increase their ability to say “no” to threat actors?
Our experts suggest three initial actions.

“A lot of corporate leaders tend to say,
‘Let the tech guys deal with this,’” says
Hodgkinson. “But they need to think about
security risk like any other operational
risk: as part of their business resilience
plan. It isn’t just a technology priority; it’s a
business priority, just like safety, financial,
or reputational risk.”

Inglis agrees. “Asset protection will
improve when organizations begin framing
cybersecurity not as a technology issue,”
he says, “but as a business or mission
assurance issue.”

Bresman suggests that corporate leaders
begin by reevaluating risk from an
operational resilience perspective.
“Every company’s leadership should want
to understand the exposure of their IT
infrastructure,” he says. “Every corporate
board should be asking their CISO two
questions. One: What is our level of risk?

**STEP 1** C-level leadership must
acknowledge ransomware defense and
identity security as business priorities.

The time has come for members of the C-suite to take a
more active interest in cybersecurity and ITDR strategy.

A combination of staff, automated solutions, and trusted partners
can help companies detect threats and mobilize quickly.

And two: What are the systems that would
completely cripple our organization if they
were taken out?”

The answers can help leaders identify
the most critical business infrastructure
components, which typically include the
identity system.

**STEP 2** Robust ITDR
solutions and expert partners
can help security leaders offset
staffing challenges.

SOCs are indispensable cyber defense
tools, but their effectiveness fluctuates.
Plus, financial and cultural pressures
make adequate security staffing,
especially outside of business hours,
a universal challenge.

“Clearly, your security posture will be stronger
on holidays and weekends if your
SOC is staffed to proper levels,” says Martin.
“Here’s where operational resilience becomes
so important, as that level of staffing might
not be possible. How quickly can you mobilize
if things go wrong?”

To fill the gaps, organizations can deploy
dedicated ITDR solutions and cultivate
relationships with trusted partners.
Automated auditing and alerting, attack
pattern detection, rollback or suspension
of unusual changes to Active Directory, and
automated Active Directory forest recovery
can all help organizations detect and respond
to threats as rapidly as possible—with minimal
demands for human intervention.

“You can replace some human monitoring with
good automation,” suggests Grillenmeier. “For
intruders to persist once they’re in, they often
need to change settings that are otherwise
static. So, you can set alarms to go off when
these settings are changed.”

Organizations with an outsourced SOC should
ensure that the provider has dedicated
backup systems for Active Directory and
a documented identity recovery plan.
Organizations that maintain in-house security
operations should also have such resources.
Those that do not or that are unsure of the
efficacy of their disaster recovery plan
should consult with a trusted ITDR expert
with experience defending, detecting, and
recovering from ransomware.

**STEP 3** Active Directory
security should be a core aspect of
every merger or acquisition.

Business and technology leaders must make
Active Directory security a priority rather than
an afterthought when planning for material
corporate events. Planning should include an
evaluation of the identity infrastructure health
as part of their financial due diligence ahead
of any possible merger or acquisition.

“Nothing in the other entity’s network should
touch yours until you’ve had a chance to
assess their cyber assets,” says Wichman.
“Have a third-party review done, see what
controls are really in place, and start
negotiations from there. The cost of that
service is a drop in the bucket compared
to the risk.”

Hodgkinson agrees. “Whether it’s obsolete
technology or security risks, those are things
they’ll need to remediate post-deal, and you’re
talking about millions of dollars,” he says,
adding that organizations should specifically
audit potential partners’ identity systems
before inking any deals. “If their Active
Directory isn’t locked down, that’s a
sign that there are other security holes
in the rest of the organization.”

As our study shows, organizations simply
cannot afford to take their attention off
cyber and identity defense, no matter
the circumstances.

“Cyberattacks, including ransomware,
often happen in the cracks—during
mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, and in
the seams of supplier-vendor
relationships,” says Kemba Walden, Paladin
Global Institute President and former Acting
US National Cyber Director. “We need
to ensure these cracks are seamless
to prevent vulnerabilities.”

“Understanding of the critical role that identity
plays within the security story has increased
significantly over the past few years. While ITDR
is finally getting the attention that it deserves,
there is still a lot to do for the protection and
security of identity systems.”

Mickey Bresman
CEO, Semperis

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Ransomware and identity defense are no longer simply IT challenges; they are business priorities.
- Active Directory security auditing is a necessary part of due diligence in advance of material corporate events.
- Expert ITDR solutions can help to automate ransomware detection and defense in the face of staffing challenges.

“Improving operational resilience during material
events takes patience and diligence. It is essential
that the CISOs at both organizations involved
in the material event connect prior to any deal
and discuss ‘must haves’ from a security standpoint before
the integration of networks begins. They should also identify
vulnerabilities and weak spots and make sure both organizations
have the best resources available to reduce risks.”

## Methodology
In the first half of 2024, global organizations across the United States, the United Kingdom,
France, and Germany participated in a detailed study on their experience with ransomware.
To conduct this study, we partnered with experts at Censuswide, an international market
research consultancy headquartered in London. Censuswide surveyed 900 IT and security
professionals across multiple industries, including education, finance, healthcare,
manufacturing and utilities, IT and telecommunications, and travel and transportation.
