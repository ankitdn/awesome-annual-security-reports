## Introduction

Human factors are crucial to the integrity of an organization’s cybersecurity framework. As highlighted by Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, a vast majority—74%—of data breaches stem from manipulative social engineering techniques and human error or oversight. As organizations fortify their technical cybersecurity defenses, adversaries rapidly adapt, opting for simpler methods of system infiltration. Cybercriminals tend to bypass the daunting task of breaching advanced technological security measures and instead focus on targeting human susceptibilities.

Consequently, employees have emerged as the preferred target for these adversaries. This positions your workforce as either your most critical defense layer, or your weakest link…you choose. The collective knowledge, attitudes and conduct of employees significantly determine an organization’s susceptibility to cyber threats. Therefore, it is imperative to cultivate a strong security culture within the workplace. Employees are at the heart of an organization’s operations and can transform into a formidable human firewall, but only if an organization invests in empowering them to recognize and respond to cyber attacks.

## The KnowBe4 Security Culture Report

The Security Culture Report is a comprehensive yearly publication crafted by the premier organization in security culture research, KnowBe4 Research. This document stands out as the most in-depth and comprehensive analysis available, offering survey findings from thousands of organizations across the globe and a rich five-year comparative perspective.

This report represents a treasure trove of data-driven insights, brought to life with easy-to-understand graphics. It dives deep into how security measures really affect organizations and the way people act and feel at work. It’s become the go-to guide for understanding the true power of a strong security culture. With its broad coverage, there’s nothing else quite like it out there.

18 Industries, 6 Continents, 111 Countries

Additionally, the report presents an intricate and exhaustive examination of 18 industries, assessing each one’s security culture readiness. It does not stop at industry-specific evaluations but extends to furnish regional insights that encompass North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and an additional noteworthy global overview.

A robust security infrastructure hinges on a multi-tiered strategy, with its foundation firmly rooted in the human element. It is essential for security culture to evolve into a persistent, ingrained practice that every member of the organization embraces as a standard operating practice. Such a culture must be like second nature—and thoroughly integrated in every layer of the organization.

The 2024 Security Culture Report is the most comprehensive study of security culture available. It stands as a comprehensive tool, equipping yourself with the knowledge and strategies to foster a more security-conscious culture within your organization.

## What is Security Culture?

KnowBe4 defines “security culture” as the ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organization’s security. Security culture is best understood as the collective mindset, practices and norms that shape how an organization approaches and prioritizes security. This encompasses shared knowledge and thinking patterns, ingrained habits of staff and employees’ demonstrated behaviors in any setting where they carry out their professional duties. When referring to the workplace, we apply a broad view of where and how work is conducted and define security in similarly broad terms.

> Under this concept, organizations are encouraged to direct their energy toward boosting employee involvement through evaluations and training, refining processes and protocols and adopting technologies that simplify adherence to security best practices.
>
> For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of security culture and strategic guidance on establishing a robust security culture program, “The Security Culture Playbook, An Exclusive Guide To Reducing Risk and Developing Your Human Defense Layer” authored by Perry Carpenter and Kai Roer, published in 2022 by Wiley, is an excellent resource.

## Security Culture Dimensions

We systematically evaluate culture across seven distinct dimensions:

- **Attitudes**: The feelings and beliefs that employees have toward the security protocols and issues.
- **Behaviors**: The actions and activities of employees that have direct or indirect impact on the security of the organization.
- **Cognition**: Employees’ understanding, knowledge and awareness of security issues and activities.
- **Communication**: The quality of communication channels to discuss security-related topics, promote a sense of belonging and provide support for security issues and incident reporting.
- **Compliance**: The knowledge of written security policies and the extent that employees follow them.
- **Norms**: The knowledge of and adherence to unwritten rules of conduct in the organization.
- **Responsibilities**: How employees perceive their role as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of the organization.

## Security Culture Index

The Security Culture Index (SCI) is the global index for rating organizations based on their security culture score. The index was created by KnowBe4 Research and is calculated by analyzing the security culture of thousands of organizations around the world.

- 90 up to 100: Excellent
- 80 up to 89: Good
- 70 up to 79: Moderate
- 60 up to 69: Mediocre
- 0 up to 59: Poor

Note: None of the industry sectors have demonstrated Excellent or Good security culture this year.

## The Security Culture Maturity Model

The KnowBe4 Research team has pioneered the Security Culture Maturity Model, an industry-first tool designed specifically to assess security culture, underpinned by a robust, data-driven and empirical approach. This innovative model draws on the extensive set of security awareness, behavior and culture data collected by KnowBe4, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful evaluation of an organization’s security posture.

A dashed red line represents breach likelihood and relative cost remediation, decreasing from Level 1 to Level 5. A solid blue line represents awareness/culture maturity gains, increasing from Level 1 to Level 5. Source: KnowBe4]

## The 5 Maturity Levels

The model describes a spectrum that includes organizations at the most basic level of compliance, where there is little to no conscious strategy for fostering awareness, behavior, or a security-centric culture (Level 1). We then look at organizations with a Sustainable Security Culture (Level 5). These organizations not only meet but exceed standard expectations, and endeavor to influence even the informal norms and social dynamics that shape their employees’ attitudes toward security. Read more about these varying levels below.

1.  **Level 1 Basic Compliance**:
    - Bare minimum of training
    - Limited metrics
    - “Check the box”
2.  **Level 2 Security Awareness Foundation**:
    - At least annual and onboarding training
    - Occasional phishing simulations
    - Focus on variety of content
3.  **Level 3 Programmatic Security Awareness & Behavior**:
    - Intentional awareness program with integrated tools
    - Quarterly training with simulated phishing
    - Focus on security-aware behaviors
4.  **Level 4 Security Behavior Management**:
    - Continuous training across varied delivery methods and audiences
    - Heavy use of integrated tools to inform training strategy
    - Program focused on real behavior change
5.  **Level 5 Sustainable Security Culture**:
    - Program that intentionally measures, shapes and reinforces security culture
    - Multiple methods of behavior-based encouragement
    - Security values woven through fabric of entire organization

## Global Overview

By Javvad Malik, Lead Security Awareness Advocate

### Cultural Adoption

The world may be your oyster, but how does it fare when looking at cybersecurity culture? Approximately 5.35 billion people have internet access, which means 66.2% of the global population are potential targets for criminals. Against this backdrop, strengthening security cultures is more than a corporate challenge. It’s a societal imperative.

Organizations around the world vary greatly in how deliberate they are in building a strong security culture that aligns with their risk tolerance and overall culture. While many governments and organizations have attempted to implement some form of cybersecurity strategy, their efforts have met varying degrees of success.

Many organizations approach cybersecurity culture in the same way they approach a technology project. However, what works for computers and networks doesn’t translate well when dealing with humans. This can be why practical steps to build a strong culture falter or regress into a compliance exercise. Such faltering mirrors the outdated security awareness and training models of years gone by, when employees were subjected to an annual dose of awareness training.

### General Attitudes

The maturity levels of security culture vary greatly across the globe. In some areas, individuals are more aware and vigilant of threats at a personal level, but these do not automatically translate to organizations. In other areas, threats are viewed more as an organizational challenge that does not impact individuals personally.

Anecdotally, it appears security culture grows stronger where it is relevant not just to an organization, but to individuals—when it is something they can take home to share with friends and family.

On a positive note, it appears as if more organizations are embedding cybersecurity initiatives beyond technological controls and understanding that people form an important part in creating a strong security culture.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)

There are many existing, updated and new regulatory requirements globally that attempt to bring cybersecurity front of mind within organizations. However, many of these fall short by focusing on technological controls, breach notification requirements or basic awareness. While these are fundamental building blocks of a security culture, they alone cannot sufficiently move the needle.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues

There are many issues around the globe impacting organizations when it comes to security culture. Cyber crime remains a priority for many organizations. The focus is largely on issues such as ransomware while ignoring the fact that social engineering remains the most prevalent method of deploying ransomware.

In 2023, these events left a lasting impact. The shifts to remote or hybrid working models required rapid deployment of technology and incurred cyber debt in the process, which negatively impacted many organizations.

As the COVID-induced panic buying of toilet rolls was starting to wane, global events introduced a new set of complex risks. In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, while the following year brought escalating conflict in the Middle East. These are significant because we’ve seen how cybersecurity has played a prominent role not only among those directly involved in such conflicts but also among supporters from afar.

### Dimensions

In 2023, we collected insights on 816,733 employees representing 4,078 organizations. The overall security culture score globally stands at 72 (low moderate), unchanged from the prior year. As one would expect, smaller organizations tend to have higher culture scores. It’s far easier to change the culture of a smaller group than a larger one. In fact, Behaviors was the only dimension in which large organizations scored higher than others.

Globally there seems to be less understanding, knowledge and awareness of security, as well as less responsibility.

While there is a great deal of variance depending on geographical location, organization size and industry, the sobering fact is that there is much work still to be done in order to raise the standard in culture.

### AI Influences

Of all new technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) will probably have some of the most profound cybersecurity impacts on organizations and individuals. AI is already being used to facilitate disinformation and misinformation campaigns, enhance social engineering attacks, and automate multi-layered and multi-faceted attacks at scale—even by attackers with little technical know-how.

In the coming months and years, as elections, wars and other notable events occur, AI will emerge as an increasingly important tool in the arsenal of criminals. With low awareness and a lack of effective regulation, by the time governments and regulators agree on a way forward, it could be too late.

### Key Takeaways

Security culture greatly varies across the world. That’s a problem in our fully connected world, where a mobile phone in the middle of a desert can interact with a stock market trading account as well as a banker in an office on Wall Street. A siloed approach is not sustainable. Governments need to collaborate more closely with each other and with regulators not just to define legislation, but also to demonstrate and embed the practical steps needed to build a strong culture.

For their part, organizations need to look at the human challenge and not treat this as a technological issue. Unlike patching computers, “patching” humans requires a sustained effort of awareness and training. To quote Nelson Mandela, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”

## North America

By Erich Kron, Security Awareness Advocate

### Cultural Adoption

The importance of security culture is gaining momentum in North American organizations, especially among leaders. The North American Manufacturing sector has sustained a decades-long emphasis on security culture, and organizations across industries have observed the fruits of this labor: safer working environments and fewer accidents. North American leaders understand how a strong culture can have similar positive impacts on cybersecurity. Many of the organizations that have successfully built a strong safety culture are applying the same strategy and tactics to improve their security culture.

Alongside cultural awareness, supply chain, vendor management, and all other types of third-party risk have become a hot topic. As such, smaller organizations supplying goods and/or services to large organizations must address their own security culture or risk losing large contracts. For organizations operating in countries that require strong physical security, the need for cybersecurity is more of an evolution than a new idea.

### General Attitudes

Organizations across North America are realizing that cybersecurity is a critical part of business. They recognize that employees aren’t the weakest link; rather, they are a key defense against these attacks. For their part, employees are realizing that while they are not expected to be cybersecurity experts, they do have a significant role in the organization’s cybersecurity readiness. Employees are learning that cyber attacks do not cease to be a threat when they head home for the day. Cyber risks are becoming a part of people’s personal lives, as well. As a result, they often become much more receptive to education and learning habits that can protect them personally.

The KnowBe4 survey found that organizations that deal with money are top performers in the security culture game. This makes sense given the stakes. Organizations in the Insurance, Financial Services and Banking industry have been targets of traditional and cyber crime for decades, so a higher level of security culture is not unexpected. Unfortunately, the Education industry comes in last with a score of 69, eight points off the leaders. This industry is often understaffed, with funding being a major hindrance. This translates into tired, hurried people, a favored target for cybercriminals. These U.S. security culture scores are similar to those across the rest of North America (Canada and Mexico).

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)

While there are a number of significant data privacy and security regulations that can impact organizations in North America, one of the more significant is related to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that publicly traded companies report a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of materiality determination.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues

Ransomware continues to be the hot topic for both executives and security practitioners due to the resulting damages and other impacts, which are often transparent to the general public. Some top new stories highlighted Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts and Clorox as targets of the same ransomware group, with losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars and countless hours of downtime.

### Dimensions

As with industry comparisons, survey data for the U.S. versus North America as a whole are quite similar, with small organizations beating out the larger ones in overall score. It’s not surprising to see that large organizations may lag in some dimensions. A key part of establishing a good security culture is communication from leadership, something that tends to be much easier for small organizations. In addition, with fewer people on staff, it makes sense that employees of smaller organizations may feel more responsibility for security. For them, it’s just another of many hats they wear as part of a small company. Among the regions evaluated in the report, North America, which represents the highest number of employees/organizations surveyed, experienced a slight decline in overall security culture score, falling one point to 73 (low moderate).

### Language Localization

Language localization is very important when working to influence security culture. While some people confuse localization with translation, the two are very different when it comes to impacting culture. Using locally relevant phrases or situations aids understanding much more than simply changing a word or phrase from English to another language. This nuance can also be important when communicating with employees who speak the same language but in different parts of the world. U.S. English, Canadian English and UK English may seem similar but can be miles (or meters) apart when it comes to making a point resonate with an audience.

### AI Influences

There is no question that AI is a hot topic, but it does not represent a completely new attack vector. Much like a certain search engine fundamentally changed the way we use the internet by making things more efficient, AI will do the same for cyber crime. It will help attackers scale up attack volumes; it will dramatically improve translations; and AI-generated deepfakes will become a valuable tool. Even so, attacks will continue to follow the same core formula. Attackers will use phishing to elicit emotional responses, and scared victims will make mistakes by wiring money or introducing malware into systems. Ultimately, defense will be the same—that is, watch for the usual signs of a social engineering ploy.

### Key Takeaways

Security culture discussions have hit the boardroom, and organizations are understanding the importance of the human factor in a successful security program. Vendors are being scrutinized more than ever and are expected to have a strong security culture themselves—simply because it is too risky to do business with soft targets for cybercriminals.

Financial organizations and those that handle large sums of money continue to lead the charge simply because the stakes are so high. Unfortunately, Government, Manufacturing and Education represented some of the lowest scores despite being some of the biggest targets, including for ransomware. In those industries, it’s crucial to spend money and other resources very wisely simply due to their scarcity.

## South America

By Joanna Huisman, Senior Vice President of Strategic Insights and Research

### Cultural Adoption

Organizations in South America are grappling with the significantly rising challenges of cyber attacks. According to the Council on Foreign Affairs, the region is often neglected for several compelling reasons. To begin with, threat intelligence firms have limited motivation to prioritize South America ahead of more expansive markets. Additionally, cybersecurity domains tend to concentrate on well-known, prominent threat actors, neglecting the rise of nascent ones. Finally, the uneven levels of development throughout the region result in markedly diverse cybersecurity requirements among the various countries.

Moreover, there is a significant communication gap between nations. Influential leaders fail to engage in the necessary dialogues that span borders, leading to systemic unpreparedness within organizations to effectively confront the core issues. This deficiency cascades to the workforce, where employees lack the requisite training to detect, report and prevent attacks. The root of the issue lies in the fact that employees may lack awareness, feel a sense of disconnection from responsibility, or exhibit apathy toward the situation.

To address this issue, organizations must first look at the human factors and adopt comprehensive, continuous training and testing to drive strong cyber hygiene practices across the workforce. This, coupled with robust business continuity plans and proactive prevention strategies, will help shift momentum toward fostering a culture where employees adopt more secure behaviors and take appropriate ownership of cybersecurity.

### General Attitudes

Recent research indicates that cyber attacks are escalating rapidly in South America, with phishing and ransomware emerging as the primary tactics. To combat these threats, security awareness training remains an essential countermeasure. Improving the security culture within South American companies requires a thorough examination of various cultural dimensions to pinpoint specific weaknesses.

By reassessing and refining their strategies accordingly, organizations can foster a more robust security culture. This heightened state of preparedness—where employees are well-informed and the company actively promotes and disseminates knowledge—can have a positive, transformative impact on security culture. Low scores in the Responsibilities dimension underscore a lack of investment in cultivating the human aspect of security, which is crucial for recognizing and responding to social engineering attacks.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
